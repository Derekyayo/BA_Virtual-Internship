0, my family flew from washington to london on a british airways a we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee our flight was unfortunately delayed by hrs from to causing us to miss a connection from gatwick to turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport onboard i sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff in flight entertainment system didn t work very well the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use it could use updating the food for dinner was decent they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards the seat was pretty comfortable and the flight was smooth after we missed our connection and we re stuck behind security for hrs waiting for escorts they rebooked us on a flight from heathrow to milan the next day gave us free bus tickets to heathrow gave us a free hotel room and gave us dinner and breakfast vouchers great customer service 
1, easy check in a t galleries south and north lounges packed only just able to get a seat didn t stay long as b gates lounge much quieter flight boarded smoothly and on time a upper deck old club world seating which is beginning to age a little however like the large toilets on this aircraft type cabin crew were all fantastic one family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success food and drink options were all very good entertainment was good overall an enjoyable flight 
2, flight delayed by an hour it happens no biggie had us change our gate at the airport never happened before but i guess it s ok gate agent asked us to check our bags and after telling him we would prefer not to do that he did it anyway second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for travel bud 
3, the staff are very rude and not trained properly no exceptions are made for children and elderly people the price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor
4, good domestic flight operated by ba cityflyer ground service at check in edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful the flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled a complimentary drink and snack albeit tiny were served generally it seems that the quality of the cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline british airways flights 
5, failed at all basic travel fundamentals our flight was delayed staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance the fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored staff were quite unpleasant 
6, they lost my baggage in a very simple situation it s been three weeks and they don t care no communication whatsoever i was at the connection checkpoint at heathrow hrs before my connecting flight the last leg of my trip an agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full and then they lose it i claim it at the arrival airport immediately now it s been three weeks no communication whatsoever the online status is still searching for your bag with no updates my conclusion is that the ba males no effort to find my missing bag and they don t care 
7, late boarding led to a one hour flight leaving two hours late a single ba staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart there had been no previous announcement of the delay once on board the captain blamed frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot 
8, as usual the flight is delayed ba try to blame someone for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sell why don t you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand 
9, i had the most fantastic ba flight today the cabin crew in my seat zone d were of the best i have experienced although the had the old style rear front seating it was comfortable and felt open and spacious ba have done great things with the menu it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre arrival meal into hkg at pm local time having left london at the night before the dinner offering was equally ample and delicious the inflight entertainment had a great collection of tv and current films and the inflight map was first rate previously not a huge ba fan but after this hour flight i could only recommend it without reserve i flew the new ba suite in j class on a recent delhi to london flight and enjoyed that product although i felt it slightly more cramped but i think ba have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way couldn t recommend ba more on this flight today
10, couldn t book in online arrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to overselling no ba staff available very helpful gatwick staff got us a bus to lhr and a flight to toulouse had knock in effect on our car booking and sharing as the rest of family had been able yo board original flight airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice 
11, london heathrow to mumbai in a boeing in business class the lounge near terminal gate b at heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings it provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost hours the on our flight featured the older club world seating not the best in class but comfortable enough i hear that the new club suites configuration is far superior british airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect all in all a very comfortable flight one minor irritant for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with wifi we got into mumbai at am a civilized time to arrive 
12, keflav k iceland to london heathrow on an a in business class the journey got off on an unpleasant note the business class line at keflav k was so long that it looked like an economy class check in it took over mins to get through there was no lounge access offered the boarding process was well handled british airways business class seats for the club europe product are terrible exactly the same as economy with the middle seat left vacant you don t even get extra pitch what made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight wifi also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient mid morning time of am 
13, terrible experience with british airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may my flight was scheduled to leave at p m in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin s place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and couldn t find any other flights with them that would work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after p m so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation that s when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abandoned travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they would have made the arrangements of course they don t explain that on their website they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga i e different airport than the one i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn t travel by train to my cousin s place any longer bags in tow and i didn t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me free avios a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they wouldn t budge very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren t the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they would never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money i ve been an executive club member for years and they simply didn t care they said there was nothing they could do i m sure if one of the ba executive s friends or family members had gone through this staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again 
14, an airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is british airways i am not joking we are a family of all in business class heading for a norwegian and arctic cruise and they lost of our bags they will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
15, check in desk rude and dismissive flight late but seems the new norm one world emerald club world check in staff uncommunicative did not know what baggage allowance entitled to once raised politely became argumentative and accusatory 
16, i chose british airways especially because i was going to travel with my niece and nephew and wanted everything to work well what a disaster first it took me two hours to do the check in online due to a technical problem i also had to spend more than minutes in a call to a uk number from my spanish cell phone because that s the only service they provide on weekends then at the airport when there was the boarding time we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on they just told us to wait finally we could access the plane after minutes inside they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled we had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours then do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off which was again delayed we spent almost hours at the airport no information was provided no solutions were offered we had to seat in the last raw when i had paid to seat on the first half of the plane no money was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given i also had pre purchased food and they couldn t provide the service all in all terrible never again 
17, i booked premium economy from inv to lax via lhr they notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for then they cancelled a flight on my journey to lax they then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me back on the first flight that they had rebooked me on the flight that i have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into lhr they re routed me from lax to jfk to lhr which i would have accepted but they booked the journey in economy lax to jfk which my husband with a knee injury cannot do and now they won t change it even though they have a direct flight from lax to lhr with premium economy and unacceptable flight allows us mins to transfer flights at jfk and my husband won t be able to walk slowly let alone quickly after enduring the hour flight from lax to lhr i have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and i also have online chat which proves i did not accept this re routed flight to jfk but they won t budge 
18, a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from london city airport to frankfurt when we purchased the tickets i mistakenly entered my name twice e g mr john smith and ms john smith little did we know that our simple mistake would cost us over pounds upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name apparently they can only change letters where there has been a typo and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight the price almost seven times higher than my original ticket zero empathy was shown zero alternative was offered trusting ba s staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted ba s commercial change booking team and informed them of our situation the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so i told this person several times i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer i would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket he said no i could claim the difference fair enough we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference two days later british airways customer response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight they ve continued to send generic emails until this week when they just stopped responding so in short british airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund it keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily 
19, flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork after this was resolved the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour which is longer than the flight takes of course ams is not bas home base and it uses contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way it ll be eurostar for me next time 
20, fast and friendly check in total contrast to gatwick the contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine food best avoided on board great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the chocolate and orange pot that seems to appear on every flight have they bought up the global stock the crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm the crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled from experience they rarely are is dry ice so expensive that ba can t afford it 
21, i don t understand why british airways is classified as a star airline the service is really mediocre the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience this really is all about getting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience the inflight entertainment is fairly good but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold personality less experience 
22, i m sure that ba have gradually made their economy experience ba euroflyer out of gatwick so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class long wait at the biz checkin due to status and dealt with by a bored agent ok third party but still representing ba who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful on board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the free water which on gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle a fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on easyjet who do two service runs etc 
23, customer service does not exist one world emerald frequent long haul flyer including ba never seen such poor customer service or computer says no official ba com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from gatwick delayed hours delayed leaving for airport only for ba to change back to original time called ba customer service hours prior from highway saying situation told not to worry would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport got to airport mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for ba so could not help back on phone hours in total to be told could be rebooked then couldn t be round and round ultimately told to file complaint then found out flight left hours delayed paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told days wait for complaints to be responded to heavens help economy and non status flyers if that s what the front end of the plane gets 
24, another really great pair of flights on time no problems at all champagne was ok and my meal choices were great the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat in flight entertainment could have been better can t wait to fly with ba again and enjoy another great experience 
25, our a developed a fault taxiing to the runway we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about hours later due to a technical fault all the while ba staff were virtually non existent it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled ba provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own no arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport finally managed to get the legal minimum compensation out of ba for the hour delay they caused to my journey and expenses were reimbursed too but even this took four weeks the fact that as a business class customer ba pays the minimum they can get away with says it all they couldn t care less about customers have no interest in loyalty and aren t bothered about your business given its our flights that pay ba s way i d suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers not recommended 
26, horrible airline does not care about their customers used to be decent but has now since really fell off a flight time of hours and mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back didn t even offer juices i would stick with another airline 
27, my family and i have flown mostly on british airways for the last years i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset was done for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic they gave us a menu asked what we d like did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else they then told us that we d get first choice at the second service which they couldn t deliver on finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of we fly british airways medium to long haul regularly possibly times a year each for us the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounges when we use them 
28, this has been by far the worst service i have had on a plane it s very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british airways they care very little about you we had to wait an hour for them to even open the check in once they did they had lines and only one that serviced economy even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments once we arrived at the gate there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn t leave the boarding area i will never fly this airline again 
29, in nov i booked and paid for a return journey to new zealand on my return journey my final flight was from london to edinburgh on trying to check in i was told my ticket did not exist i showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket my only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost since nov ie months ago i have communicated multiple times with ba in an attempt to have my money returned they have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me i finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of i have asked for an explanation but have received none only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct i do not intend to let this matter go a company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund ps they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it i tracked it down myself a week later to edinburgh airport and picked it up myself 
30, ba is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect you pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane this is short changing passengers 
31, hours before our departure on ba to cape town from heathrow on thursday th june we did an online check in seats had already been allocated for my wife and i e and f which are the middle two seats of the central block of four these were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late s and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle but there were no other seats available we got to heathrow about hours before departure and tried to change seats at check in to no avail although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost she did offer us an upgrade to premium economy but at gbp each it was beyond our affordability she said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed we spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic the economy seats are so tiny that i was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger with knees touching the seat pocket in front for hours we suffered when we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me ba economy is absolutely awful the evening meal was near inedible both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying especially for an older person the breakfast spanish omelette was however not bad at all the previous day we had flown economy from malta to heathrow on malta airlines and that hour trip was a pleasure the seats are wide and there is ample legroom if they can do it then why not british airways 
32, we arrived at heathrow at to find our flight to ibiza was cancelled by ba with no explanation as if that wasn t galling enough the customer service from ba at the airport was non existent there was no explanation no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight we ve managed to find another flight from stansted but that isn t until much later today thus wasting a chunk of our short trip i simply don t understand why ba don t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation and work with them to resolve the problem shocking customer service 
33, original flight was cancelled with no explanation there was no representative to help in rebooking we had to call customer service long distance call the line kept dropping had to do calls to find new booking only to discover the only way i could fly the next day was by paying business class no help with hotel for the night stay 
34, airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency flight was delayed with no communication given boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible there is next to no recline however i was thankful that there was no recline if the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this a aircraft no amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small no ife no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time 
35, flight fine in line with competitors pleasant crew only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at heathrow it seems like this is standard for the berlin flights would use again 
36, came from glasgow to london and took connecting flight american airlines from london to north carolina it s my third day here in north carolina and still waiting for my luggage they didn t even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight luggage are still in glasgow 
37, my flight on on may got delayed an hour and minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on may as the arrival of the first flight was only before the departure of the second connecting flight we contacted the ba call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the th of may to kef airport through different flights the team tried to find a solution but none made sense not even on the next day the th of may we have made full booking of accommodation car rental activities etc for the vacation in iceland the cancellation of of these booking is not refundable the call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight british airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all even though we paid additional on new bookings and additional charges the refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week i was promised to get refund on the first call but later i found out it was not processed properly every time i call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment after multiple calls i was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level i had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded the whole experience was terrible 
38, cairo is a hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment not even a magazine which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for you have to pay for your seat choice checked in baggage food drink wifi not that i have anything against that i m used to that on budget airlines but this is for a premium price ticket i would have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket would have been less and the extras would have been half the price the ba app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra and don t get me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairo london route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers and for the flyers who don t want the hassle of charges minimal cabin service and budget seats then they could easily provide a premium economy option and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal compounds the poor experience especially for arrivals it is also poorly served by transport links especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abandoned by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many years and was even a ba gold card holder at one point so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice do i fly budget or do i fly more comfortably for more now it s a case of flying budget or flying budget for double the price with ba 
39, after travelling london to madrid with british airways then with iberia from madrid to lima and latam to cuzco my luggage arrived days after me when attempting to collect my luggage mine was the only one not to arrive i sought help and was informed to make a claim online when my bag finally arrived days later the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched someone emptied my st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about i felt violated i have been treated appallingly from start to finish for a month i have been back and forth to british airways yet they stated it is not their fault 
40, my luggage was mis tagged in dallas on my way to cairo via london my luggage arrived at lhr as planned on saturday however upon arrival due to the luggage being mis tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage it was never sent to cairo its sitting in terminal in lhr i have an air tag on my luggage and british airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it i have filed claims made phone calls have been hung up on x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at ba refuse to solve the problem 
41, the airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip they gave me no updates their website sucks and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone they finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the us days after i told them to ship it back to the us now i ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me they appease me on the phone tell me they re fixing it but nothing changes the hotel can t get in touch with them and they haven t even tried to pick to bag back up several times when i called i got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to call back later 
42, we booked on the ba website round trip flights from seattle to amman with a stop in london in business class our first flight was delayed and then diverted to nyc and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency when we landed in nyc we were taken to a hospital and i stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer the same evening we flew back home confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport for the next several weeks we spoke many times with ba customer service trying to obtain some kind of refund we were met with contradictory explanations excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service we discovered we had been marked as no shows for our flight to amman and that our return flight was still active we were unable to cancel the return on the website despite booking on the website our phone calls were never returned we spent a minimum of minutes on hold for every phone call we made our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations we were told it was not possible to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service i filed a complaint with the faa in response to my complaint i received an email from ba customer service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a full refund but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules they would issue flight credits except for the portion for which we no showed they did not state how many credits we never once asked for a full refund we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund we will not use the credits we were fully refunded by our travel insurance 
43, first time flying with ba business class never again there are no boarding drinks provided my meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine on arrival at bodrum my bags were among the last to appear not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight 
44, you can buy sandwiches and crisps but don t expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food didn t recognise the flight number and the onboard wifi didn t work 
45, this is a two for one review covering economy and business class on the ba flight from london city to ibiza economy was excellent a very light lunch small cheese and pastrami sandwich chocolate brownie followed by a pretty much free flowing drinks trolley the flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job this is a flight i would recommend except don t fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for in each direction as i did i flew economy out and business back while my brother flew business then economy the business seats are identical to economy with no seats blocked so you are squished in four abreast the meals are almost identical with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your the only real plus is champagne but on my flight there was none because of supply issues the cabin attendant i think his name was tom must be one of the best in the business i didn t eat so i paid for nothing oh well so great flight but stick with economy 
46, absolutely horrible airline communication is terrible last minute delays cancellations seat changes with no communication app and website user experience is years behind other airlines seats are cramped and uncomfortable overpriced would not fly again 
47, having experienced delays and cancellations departing from usa to europe and now a hour estimated delay at lhr heading back to usa i would warn travelers that ba has become unreliable and is now on my do not fly list until they get better organized 
48, travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey days later world traveller aka economy class both flights departed on time return flight landed early but we then had a hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok fa s particularly on return flight pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful no legroom at all no better in club class either only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall 
49, this flight failed at every level we were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another minutes for us but this was a ba holiday we pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound british airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in heathrow as there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on wednesday evening having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday i might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available i would like to make it clear that we are british airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically 
50, beware of british airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest they won t treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes we recently had a trip home planned from mrs to sea a mechanical issue meant that we departed late from mrs to lhr where we needed to make a connecting flight we landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate but a series of issues and choices by british airways kept us from boarding our next plane the crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines plus we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed we were pushed to virgin atlantic to figure out how to get us home it extended our travel day by hours we were traveling with children as well no offers of compensation or upgrades were made and now ba is refusing to provide us any financial compensation we paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections multiple airlines to deal with security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on that is not what we paid for but ba refuses to make it right so beware potential travelers 
51, i flew from cairo to heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat horrible service i get to heathrow airport minutes late so i had to run around looking for my connecting flight finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate given a seat that is different than what i paid extra for it s a shame for such well known airline 
52, i flew with numerous airlines but i gotta admit british airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support i waited weeks for a ticket change call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up they told me i was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes but never got they don t have a live chat just like american airlines do they don t have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number total garbage 
53, we were traveling as a family people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check in the lady at the check in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didn t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldn t figure out what was wrong we only didn t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a year old and a year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there 
54, flight at am from dub to lcy cancelled pm night before no text message no phone waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option hang on what s this it was dark at am it was hard to see mobile phone screen i m still jet lagged only option was to lhr at am tried calling no one there so accepted it but i didn t see the day change it was the next day i didn t want the flight as was staying at docklands hence choosing lcy but thought i better take it as it s leaving an hour after the original flight nope i better call to say hey sorry i screwed up your flight is not going to work for me i don t have any more accommodation in dublin and i don t want to waste one night in london called the most surly customer service can you even be called that when you treat people like this answered she kept calling me james not my name she was brutal you accepted it i can t do anything she basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion i accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer she kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen but if you had called us we could have put you onto a aer lingus flight why didn t you call you are at fault just so callous and uncaring she wanted to charge me pounds in new flights and change fees i said nope and booked a flight today with ryanair plus i need to find my way from gatwick to docklands more money from me because of ba s utter contempt for their passengers i ve been flying qantas for years and they can do some funky stuff but never this level of cruelty because of one simple error never again how do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude welcome to the u k just wow 
55, terrible i have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights the customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as i no longer intend to use ba for any further flights terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff 
56, the customer service is ugly tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight all i get is someone in india i thought i was flying iberia once i looked close at ticket it was british airways will never fly british airway ever again 
57, most uncomfortable flight i have ever experienced it s a long time since i have flown long haul the cramped conditions were awful the rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my tv was so close i couldn t focus on it ba seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade this has not worked on me i will avoid flying ba in future my onward flight was with latam same aircraft but more room between rows far more comfortable on the return flight from santiago the lights were turned down at pm i feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service they just disappear behind the curtains 
58, i booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to monaco i gave us over hours for our connecting flight to and from home through heathrow our flight left seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight we were rescheduled before we even landed they booked us on a flight hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue no earlier flights were available when we arrived in nice france the airport was closed including the rental car desk we were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night we found a cab which cost us euros one one to get to our hotel we thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home we were wrong our flight from nice to heathrow was minutes late with a hour layover you would think we should still make our flight unfortunately long security lines caused over hr further delay when arriving ba closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving mins before departure after running through the heathrow airport and going through security again they sent us back to the customer service queue where the first statement was we can t get you out until tomorrow after begging they found us a flight on another airline at that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with delta we were given pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional hour delay in total for our trip there and home we spent hours at heathrow airport which our original total layover of hours and we were offered pound each unfortunately the drama continues the two bags that they said made the delta flight shockingly did not we were told that we had the file the claim with delta since the last part of our flight was with them we have now been home for days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other as i said to both of them today i don t care who has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage i don t want your reimbursement per bag as that doesn t come close to the memories and stuff that i have in there i will never fly british airways again and delta s baggage people are not doing great either 
59, my husband and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba on february and return on march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on one occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry spicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british airways 
60, may flew from seattle to heathrow then to edinburgh ba lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes club rentals tees balls i had tee times at two courses in st andrews that took months to make the promised my bag returned in hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses i contacted ba and they state they would only reimburse toiletries then the return flight home was randomly canceled by ba without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight i contacted the corporate travel team they informed me ba canceled my return reservation they rebooked me on the same flight ba customer service was horrendous and make false promises i will never use this airlines again beware of british airways they also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members 
61, i went through three flights to reach my destination all of my ba flights without exception were delayed both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent what s not understandable is that they weren t prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so i ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after hours of traveling i had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since ba didn t communicate properly with them i gave ba a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that i had the last flight with which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints i contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn t address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me for the kind personnel that s holding this airline together though 
62, an excellent flight in club world on british airways the welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight the crew were attentive friendly and very professional on board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines in flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio the seat flat bed was very comfortable british airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the a i liked the sleek minimalist design this flight showed that ba can be among the world s best airlines 
63, the flight schedule was delayed for one hour after boarding the plane we were delayed at least another minutes when we arrived in london we were delayed again for at least another minutes to find a gate we were left with minutes only to catch our connecting flight to barcelona we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight when we arrived at barcelona airport we discovered that our check in luggage was still in london very painful trip disrupted our vacation not flying with ba anymore if i can find alternative airlines 
64, the worst experience in all my years of travel my first flight with my two kids from boston to london was delayed by hours resulting in me missing my connecting flight despite having a layover of approximately hours i ended up waiting until pm to board my flight to cairo unfortunately even that flight was delayed i would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline even if it means paying a bit more for a different option 
65, the worst experience in all my years of travel bag was destroyed flight delayed hours and couldn t get water on board then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldn t work you can t contact them plane was filthy and someone else s belongings and left over food was still in our seat 
66, terrible delays had to rebook our domestic travel for passengers and haven t received any reimbursement on the same lost all my luggage received luggage after days had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding no customer service rep picks up the phone 
67, a serious medical problem appeared while i was onboard i informed the crew and they helped me out unfortunately i was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell i became also i could not find my way back home in my condition thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until i returned back home it was a stressful experience but the crew of british airways made it way more tolerable 
68, i haven t flown british airways before and will never fly them again the check in process was terrible and slow there were over people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it they had one agent working the first class line it should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service we had to run to the gate and we did make it but they were terrible 
69, my itinerary was supposed to be las vegas chicago london venice when i landed in london heathrow i was stuck on the aircraft for hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay i missed my connecting flight to venice getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place our flight had over people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight they put us into two lines one of them being for people who missed their flight i waited approximately minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me since i missed my flight i would have to go to the connecting flight ba service desks for further assistance if i were to have known that was the only information i would receive i would have skipped being in that line altogether when i went to the service desk where there were more than people standing in line i waited minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the ba site since their systems were down and couldn t rebook anyone it was a hassle doing anything through he ba site so i ended up calling the helpline after waiting to be connected to a ba rep i spoke with a woman who said i would have to call iberia airlines for a rebook i called iberia and they said since i booked through expedia i would have to call them expedia then said i would have to call ba for the rebook so when i called ba again the rep said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following monday mind you i was travelling since the th which was a friday all the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked i was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went i still don t have it most of the customer service i got from ba reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me they acted like i was inconveniencing them with my issues i also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked overall my experience with british airlines has been the worst airline experience i ve ever had to deal with i will never book with this company again i would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again 
70, busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good 
71, worst seats i have ever encountered in economy class no leg room at all i had to spread my legs to fit staff at the terminal rude business class offers the same seat but with more legroom and they block the middle seat they cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane where there is more legroom just so the business class passenger has an empty seat between them plane is old with no onboard entertainment for a hours flight last time i will fly british airways 
72, top ten reasons to not use british airways to all be aware and be on notice travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly don t waste your time or money customer service is non existent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your money you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your money to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered trust me the number is a secret when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if someone answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership what airlines operates days a year and around the clock but doesn t have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways that s who they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text if you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not get notifications if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesn t matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are done paying for seats they will route to another partner airline and not notify you if you have a connecting flight they will cancel one leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps one person that heeds my advice then my job is done 
73, easy check in on the way to heathrow the flight was on time with no issues our return flight to valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at heathrow this was with another airline and was not a connecting flight i asked at the british airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at heathrow we had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes that is indeed customer service thank you 
74, online check in worked fine quick security check once onboard quick flight up to glasgow water and snack provided all in all very pleased cheap quick and efficient 
75, the ba first lounge at terminal was a zoo at pm dirty tables and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started mins late the flight was operated by a finnair a which is barely low cost standard let alone business class hard thin uncomfortable seats poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty i remain shocked that ba allow this and it s time for ba s ceo and management focused on standards rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down budget airline type service as the whole trip turned out to be and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips i thought post covid that ba were better for a few months but with the many cost cuts they are making they fall well below all other european full service airlines 
76, paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal which was very crowded being in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b and waited there for mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in a and c seat b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it would not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and non existent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money
77, words fail to describe this last awful flight baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhr sfo it s understandable for a baby to cry nonstop but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food was so bad that most turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scones i ve said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service i e don t do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work this time i swear i mean it never again on ba please the lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat poor ba is on the skids downhill 
78, absolutely terrible experience the app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid documents but then did not accept them even when provided i was trying to fly back to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors i went to british airways customer service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger even though i was there in plenty of time this was also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flights were limited i was delayed over hours in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport 
79, ba overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer it means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage makes easyjet and ryanair look like customer champions the server in itsu in the ba terminal says she stopped flying ba years ago due to the service being bad all the time most customers she serves have a complaint staff don t care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence 
80, the flights were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight the seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my money on pe seat you can get hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won t use them again 
81, only the second time flying ba as first time wasn t positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another bad show business class fare should offer more 
82, i wasn t going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no pre departure drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great 
83, i booked business class tickets for my fianc and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to get have my flight refunded the representative on the phone informed me he wasn t sure how much i would get as the refund department needed to check but estimated i would lose of my booking to fees i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received total back less than of my booking costs since then i have spent over hours calling different departments before they blocked me i ve lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show 
84, i will never travel with british airways again i spent over on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing cabin has seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal bar the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights back to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is i paid it but note that there were only seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british airways 
85, i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i was minutes late calling them even though i tried for hours to get through the day before now i am unable to get back and they have kept the pounds customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you 
86, terrible avoid this airline it s now becoming regular practice to cancel flights had a cancellation from switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices 
87, despite being a gold member the british airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first hours as if that would make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans 
88, regarding the aircraft and seat the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was one of the only times i ve been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry bag was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and don t provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wi fi in business class is not acceptable another example of ba s penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty bad i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the vegetables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast wasn t much better summary ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i would choose them over ba these days 
89, i travelled with british airways from sweden to los angeles via london in december when i arrived at lax one of my bags were missing there was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about minutes i found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind i gave her my details of where i would be staying and she told me that they would contact me after a few days and still no contact i tried to call british airways customer service the woman at the airport didn t give me a file reference number so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days i told them that i had switched hotels and gave them the address for where i was staying and everything was fine but then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i was flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasn t his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questioned him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one i came home and a couple of days later i received my bag i made a complaint and claims on british airways website since i had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because i didn t have my bag in january they said that they would refund me for my claims it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations i don t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british airways and the lack of customer service 
90, food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us hours just to go from t to t and clear security check the place was chaotic we get to our boarding gate and again a long line with minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline 
91, had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again 
92, the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience 
93, second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year 
94, they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal and sleep there finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed one day work and ba didn t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats 
95, at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
96, worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british airways so many issues with getting from one destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic we are sorry email with avios attached which is equivalent to maybe on a flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn t even address one single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss 
97, due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i can t describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didn t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way you won t get anything else for hours you know the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid for wi fi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldn t even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful what i don t understand is why it seems that british airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew 
98, lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought back their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about years out of date the public washrooms in t are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in bags only to get on a flight that was less than full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only mins late breakfast had choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i wouldn t mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really don t care any more breakfast trays cleared mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid for hours wifi and dropped connection for the next mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class baggage handling do not waste your money on club europe standards just keep dropping 
99, i wouldn t recommend british airways at all i tried to call to customer service for times in different days and time and i waited for more than minutes on the phone i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for weeks website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you don t receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely wouldn t recommend it is such a shame that in they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
100, absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal i had to take a bus to terminal the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to pounds and we would be reimbursed i was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to get the reimbursement ba said it wasn t their problem and that it was iberia s problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don t want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus back to terminal their people gave out false information 
101, this is the worst airline not one thing went right i don t understand how they have got it so bad late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over minutes to arrive horrendous
102, i will never fly british airways again to start the plane was over hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasn t really business class there were a few aisles not separated in any way in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class 
103, worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a hour flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i would not entertain using ba again ground staff were great it s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more 
104, i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only one downside when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took minutes i believe the heathrow t were having strike action that week 
105, why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it can t be training who would do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the new club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was one only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in 
106, after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british airways to reimburse me but because i didn t have the receipt for my old luggage they would only cover of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don t get ripped off like i did 
107, literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets together with my partner we were then separated sorry the flight is full the flight then took off minutes late no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude whoops not sure how that happened what do you want genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba
108, i swore i would never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary tea coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i can t think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet 
109, obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have gone down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really don t need to get worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i wouldn t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious 
110, lost out of checked bags denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba from lhr to ord on april ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online check in never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately i ve lost respect for british airways disgusted 
111, i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about years ago when they were getting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate budget irish airline 
112, boarding at mumbai was chaotic and badly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didn t suffer from the new narrow seat which i think would have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i don t think for full flight is bad value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasn t really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick it felt like it was am even though it was pm no queues or waiting at all even the baggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be 
113, mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isn t too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to ba s club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food bar really pleasant we flew an older with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge lay out there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without secundary checks we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar cart service i love the double servings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really don t understand ba stuck to it through the years no one like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it 
114, very poor service very frustrating firstly my flight to lhr was cancelled on mar while i got a text message to inform me the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam once this was confirmed i went to the counter to get my new boarding pass at the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in mins for the hotel we me and other fellow travelers waited for over mins there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions the transfer hotel was mins away from the airport when we got to the hotel which is around pm the staff informed that dinner closes at that was a rush it appeared more of a motel than an hotel the room was smelling of weed being a non smoker this was uncomfortable although i wanted to compromise and rest when i went to wash my face the tap on the sink came off in my hands i panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room after some discussion they agreed to change it i went to the alternate room to my horror it was occupied i asked the staff to call a cab and i left 
115, generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a there would be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were u s no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away 
116, ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for minutes 
117, flew from london heathrow to marrakech ba changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats boarding was chaos staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold i had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels this airline is going downhill rapidly 
118, i was meant to fly in january to algeria i paid over for the ticket just a few days before i was meant to fly my wife broke her foot i had to then rebook it in march and pay another i called british airways weeks before my flight in march and i told them again that it had to me rebooked as my wife was still not well they told me that i don t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as i sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn t well however they never sent me the ticket they made me wait for nearly weeks and they asked me to pay either on top of the that i paid previously or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of tax only i found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money i previously paid each time i call them they hang up on me or they continue telling me to pay i made a complaint and nothing happened 
119, we have flown repeatedly with british airways and the one world alliance over the last few weeks every flight was delayed now we are back at the airport in miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight finally our luggage arrived in puerto rico with a day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip we haven t received any information about our luggage to this day luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there the last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they can t do anything wir sind in den letzten wochen immer wieder mit britisch airways und dem one world zusammenschluss geflogen jeder flug war versp tet nun sitzen wir wieder in miami am flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive versp tung sodass wir unseren anschlussflug verpassen werden zuletzt ist auch unser gep ck mit tagen versp tung in puerto rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren rundreise umplanen wir haben bis heute noch keine info ber unser gep ck erhalten zum gl ck haben wir selbst am flughafen nachgesehen und es war da beim letzten verpsp teten flug meinte die kabinen crew dass auch sie ihre anschlussfl ge verpassen und wir im selben flugzeug sitzen und sie k nnen nichts machen 
120, i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they don t even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre meal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic ml bottle of water it s just a sip on the shorter flights the seats couldn t even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost hours and we had to wait on board 
121, the worst cabin experience ever cramped seats very low cost style and uncomfortable could suit for short flights but not for a hours service catering is also a shame ml of water a chocolate bar for a hours service will never fly ba again 
122, first time flying with british airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbai to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine i appreciated that they didn t come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping the meals weren t that great to be honest after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage didn t make it due to the short connection time in london the ba baggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient 
123, the latest affront stood in first class line for an hour finally go up front and the ba agent let supposed vips with large to be checked bags in front of all of us arrogant and unapologetic add this to a long list of post covid disappointments we are done with ba 
124, booked a flight return flight between london and munich for to in december the return flight was cancelled and re booked from to british airways only notified me of the first change but not the second getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions each time needing to find a helpful representative british airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket they tried to charge an change fee through repeatedly calling back british airways reinstated my flight on and then again on to make sure it did not get changed again i checked the status of my ticket daily from to it was intact those days on when it was time to check in for the flight it was gone at the airport the staff at the british airways check in counter are not ba employees so cannot help resolve problems there are no ba representative at the munich airport the confirmation documentation from british airways was of no value i was left stranded at the airport 
125, i tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible i was given no reason for this i telephoned ba customer service and must have wasted nearly hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information staff need customer training better knowledge of their product and some manners ba customer service was virtually non existent i will never fly with them again 
126, a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after re routing via vancouver which added over hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put back hours is now delayed by another hours avoid british airways like the plague 
127, our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone outbound lgw dbv boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the pinnacle seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour messy ill fitting uniforms and unclassy make up toilets clean and maintained appreciate anti bacterial wipes being kept available post covid inbound dbv lgw for some reason no online or app check in available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual check in though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful pro actively offered to take our larger hand luggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for minutes for no reason it s truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements during the flight one couldn t even remember where we flying back to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new slimline ones ba are installing from row onwards these seats have barely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable we landed minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we d been stranded for hours we d spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given because in the context of the short haul market thats what they deserve we fly ba as we don t fly the low cost carriers after so many bad experiences but it s by no measure good just the least bad option given point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard 
128, if i could give a minus rating i would supposed to be lhr ams at on th march get to lhr at email to say flight cancelled no one able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcy ams at so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not ba s fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the departure go to desk to drop bag and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the flight to rotterdam the and were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from ams lhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just don t care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you really need to go 
129, plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen but on arrival at heathrow the plane sits on the runway for minutes as there was no free stand to go to then once at the stand we waited another minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane just pathetically inefficient 
130, we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it was not was premium we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times ba s premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok the flight back was in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had one would not recline and one reclined without using the button ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs they have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs i would rather pay more and fly with someone else 
131, this was literally one of the worst experiences i haven t been to an airport since it began in orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags even though i booked through to dublin another hours i was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i wouldn t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party 
132, the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on th february at this happened to be our first flight with our newborn month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under hrs before scheduled departure the original th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express i d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up getting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way back from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite one of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly minutes to speak to someone who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to computer says no if this is the service level for silver members i can t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the phone originally connected to a person i had to wait minutes as his computer booted up ba then proceeded to auto book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the auto booked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location km apart they couldn t understand my frustration eventually someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at not ideal as i d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn t refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to get all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should get on the app to rebook at this point i didn t know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening ba unfortunately that meant hrs in the grotty lounge with a month old baby it appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you get free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didn t get our push chair stroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy sympathy understanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with 
133, lost my case and took weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after weeks i had a business class flight scheduled on dec manchester copenhagen bangkok and return flight dec bangkok stockholm manchester sas airlines left manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control when i arrived in copenhagen to get the connecting flight for bangkok we were minutes too late and the flight had gone half of the plane missed it sas airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being copenhagen sas london ba dubai emirates bangkok i returned from copenhagen to london and the collected my boarding pass at ba we were over hours late leaving london due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight we arrived in dubai late and was informed the flight had gone emirates then informed me that i had to speak with thai air to get another flight issued i spent over an hour phoning thai air with nobody picking up the phone i then spoke with thai air dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that i buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later i paid for a kuwait airways flight out of dubai kuwaiti bangkok whilst in dubai i checked with kuwait airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from london and they would locate it and forward to my bangkok address the following day my baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms i arrived back home yesterday and was informed by ba that they have found my bag in london 
134, the incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because french air traffic controllers were on strike so we were routed over germany and not ba s fault o arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance it took around minutes to find someone then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge all told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate total disruption wasted time absolutely no excuse for this 
135, back in december my family and i as we were getting onto the plane were refused even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked months in advance we were refused it turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn t let all the passengers on the plane so quite randomly not people were selected and turned away we were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if i had connecting flights in london etc i sought compensation from ba which i was told i could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been they wouldn t acknowledge my complaint for my family until i had an authorisation letter from them saying i could act on their behalf even though i booked and paid for the tickets so i uploaded the authorisation letter no less than times every time they told me they received it and every time i followed it up they told me they hadn t there was no other way except to post from australia to the uk to some office eventually it finally go through to them i have now chased up the reimbursement four times each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient today they tell me that they need to check my account details so again i send them the same information that i have done before and i wait patiently for my reimbursement i am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away well you know what i won t 
136, as usual the flight is delayed this week it already hours and i m held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane i really can t explain how much i detest british airways if it was a cheap budget airline i could accept it but it s premium prices for the most unreliable service 
137, a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time within lhr standards and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can t 
138, we are flying business class for most of our flight and then premium economy for the balance in addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional pp for our seats now ba is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife i when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional to be re seated next to each other they moved our seats away from each other and we shouldn t have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together we haven t even flown yet this airline is horrible 
139, i am in australia and on friday night went online to book a flight from heathrow to malpensa milan i did not realise that when i specifically searched for flights to malpensa it offered options to other airports in milan when i received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in milan the itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the hour cooling off period as it was the weekend here i was unable to reach their office until monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as i had missed the hour cooling off period apparently as the ticket was issued in the uk i needed to contact them i have now cancelled the ticket and i will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying british airways 
140, at am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried times ba provide telephone number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair 
141, would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhr ist was no frills but jfk lhr was impeccable good food lots of movies cds on the ife open bar service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink snack 
142, flew premium only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room penny pinching means there s no other benefit one drink service on hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was badly organised food left on tables min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing premium about this new planes have been decorated terribly feels like you re in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if it s not too expensive seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if you re in the middle 
143, first our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable however it lost us one day s experience in cairo we were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats on both flights as my husband had spasms he had to stretch his legs across my lap and not once did any of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling as the service came to us for food each choice we made we were told they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left i did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints they responded with a pound voucher for our group 
144, although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers 
145, boarding was decently organised the a still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a was nearly full rather poor amenity bag the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority 
146, boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks nothing wrong for such a short flight fa s were very friendly and landing on time 
147, my original flight was cancelled just over weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service 
148, delayed just for a change poor communication british airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline customer service is impossible to contact and it seems ba tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when it s available 
149, very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board huge line for toilets min into a min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar 
150, check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed mins early and then waited minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice 
151, my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on th february i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the check in line and told a check in agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop 
152, this was my first time flying with ba i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but that s not really a huge issue 
153, lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb th our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at and had several delays until then we had to wait minutes for our luggage to arrive 
154, ba on the boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba 
155, not only my first flight in years but also my first time back to england for years i flew from pmi lgw on and returned on both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable total cost for both flights was regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom i m tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughman s and ipa beer total on both flights i have flown times in the last years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgw lhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline i ve flown with 
156, my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didn t know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn t do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from am till pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldn t wait until am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at am they didn t charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities 
157, organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe 
158, outward journey ba london to buenos aires club world january our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats f and j another passenger was occupying f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rolls pastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus january was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crew s professionalism throughout it s a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above 
159, check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections we re very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money 
160, very disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at pm on was cancelled replaced by a flight at pm it took off hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug i m only but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and take off slots 
161, excellent service both on the ground and on board while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg 
162, good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold 
163, a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good night s sleep fruits etc first couldn t manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard
164, this flight was one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained small glasses of juice i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price 
165, it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba 
166, as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over decades multiple times a year on th january i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the th january by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the th january they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund it s lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly the total cost of my booking was which comes to per passenger leaving my refund total at less than of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than refund even when i m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone probably for more money than it was worth a week ago 
167, a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on ba s part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time 
168, easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in 
169, being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold he was really accommodating and it wasn t a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at all saying the other guy shouldn t have let me and they will have a word with him come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier 
170, i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly when on a hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great what you got for your money not so much 
171, flew atl to lhr th jan was unlucky enough to be on board a year old refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinks snacks offered meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average 
172, great thing about british airways a is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner wafer thin bits of dry turkey over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline 
173, the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day and ba staff over the phone say call after hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we don t have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after days 
174, probably the worst business class experience i ve ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional on a single leg lhr lax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vie lhr leg the boarding time for the a was over minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a s were delivered online check in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website and did not upload any covid documentation i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vie lhr leg the shop ba com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhr lax leg there was no pre meal beverage service and there were no mid flight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the pre landing snack of a ploughman s lunch being downright disgusting there was no beverage or bar set up in the galley areas beverages available to passengers during the flight as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i won t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery 
175, definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i don t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person s legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space i ve unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least times within the last months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen 
176, ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesn t always get the best of comments at times it s reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i don t know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but it s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips 
177, i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that s about it ife didn t work but wasn t that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon 
178, when will ba update their business class cabin across on a it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable check in ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive 
179, paid day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at maybe its a long flight but their offers of or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been or with the luggage fiasco i can t rate it more than 
180, ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why can t the champagne white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad what s become of ba 
181, absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldn t get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future 
182, vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec nd we received an email on dec th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there won t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to check in hours before take off we found that our van lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional per person price difference and the dates offered were about days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out the customer service person would take minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for 
183, old a with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t 
184, another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under called before the people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out i ll have the prawn cocktail to start please no you won t as they ve only loaded one for people and the guy in a got it i bet he felt like he d won the lottery ok i ll have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains i ll have the curry no you won t as they ve substituted that with christmas dinner i m going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldn t eat it so basically my husband and i have spent on return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots 
185, ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad if they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the th despite the road to keflav k being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered not really 
186, ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city hours later my car was at heathrow i didn t want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could get home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the months on it s such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we ve booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service 
187, turned up hours in advance terminal at london heathrow was already carnage s of people trying to check in only desks manned long queues at security due to only lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha hours wait til next one received a voucher approx for the whole day arrived day later my suitcase didn t arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i don t know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs 
188, boarding at gate at lgw they called group to board we were world traveller plus group then called anyone in groups whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you don t use them cabin crew treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service we were in the final row of six in wt which has a total of seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for back row seats but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given wt meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadn t thought of that food some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks they ran out of red wine hours into an hour flight toilets there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glasses cups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future 
189, missing baggage customer service was the worst i ve ever experienced i arrived back in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where i received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear back within hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon 
190, british airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the check in staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost hr to board passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the bar service was good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne on board and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a featured wi fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to ba com and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there 
191, stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique push me pull you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas 
192, seat horribly narrow on a thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well 
193, glasgow to london delayed by hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you won t be disappointed planning ahead there s a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld it s extremely risky 
194, when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under i decided to take it but then the website wouldn t allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the check in agent was helpful but couldn t fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasn t too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better i ve obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good 
195, i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet meal service could not get more unprofessional rows took two guys nearly mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i don t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that afternoon tea consisting of three canapes like bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after mins plates to be taken away when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any no co ordination between the crew crew busy chatting at the galley in reality the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for 
196, disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard 
197, during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn t even order any food drink because the card reader didn t function the first and last time we ll fly with ba 
198, i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by hours as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest x plane i have seen packed in like sardines my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day 
199, booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a way street 
200, extremely sub par service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered 
201, i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shout out to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive i m going to have to start spending those avios 
202, i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights 
203, british airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldn t let me check in until hours before the flight i have been trying for hours to check in through their website and or find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i didn t think they were speaking english 
204, flew from amman to london on nov not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is h m we received exactly ml of water and about potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldn t even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it 
205, this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august st i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost bag i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they re not even getting back to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba 
206, flying lhr t to cpt november ba app and website not working properly would not load my ticket lhr t smooth and calm checking process quick but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba 
207, worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only bag i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible 
208, check in was a shambles at bwi just counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check in queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey 
209, beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service 
210, on july th i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and we ve lost days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in weeks i will be receiving it it s months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow ups on the matter 
211, i booked the flight on oct but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i can t get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another person s flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways 
212, london to gibraltar on th october i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience 
213, i ve generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route i m after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at but after continuous delays finally left hours late not ideal when you ve then got an hr flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldn t get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didn t want to be on board we re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at am for the pm flight 
214, a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels provided etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that s my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatar s standards but that s another story 
215, i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival 
216, just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though it s just become an experience to be endured ba s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to ba s delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn t travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any but it s hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys 
217, a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wi fi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats 
218, baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered a is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yin yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days 
219, evening flight from lhr to iad on an a check in at t is poor most of their kiosks don t work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention 
220, we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the hour check in i spent to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn t recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the hour check in only to be told no they don t do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they can t refund the cost of booking the seat emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadn t payed for the seats prior to the hour check in then a voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain 
221, while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response 
222, lhr lax i prefer the boeing over the a as the seats don t seem too cramped check in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine 
223, flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fa s especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent inch touch screen refused to pay ba s extortionate pre pay to book your seat fees and still got seats together c mon ba do we not pay enough already to travel club class i can recommend ba s new club class and we will travel this way if we can afford it in future 
224, i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend 
225, london to cairo first on this hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order 
226, this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba 
227, hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase 
228, dfw lhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a left me with the feeling that this plane type won t ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasn t too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre landing snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but i m not sold on the a t at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is 
229, check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off mins behind schedule with a minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t was as long as the flight 
230, check in at lhr t was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly 
231, the check in process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intra european business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t such things will affect their reputation 
232, this is my first time flying ba s new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre pandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class 
233, my am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than h notice without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only get me a flight days later they did not work with me as i miss days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is seat available so i changed to am from gothenburg heathrow jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp as i changed my flight a nd time i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation i m entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs 
234, i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i don t know how you manage to keep smiling couldn t fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i can t wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you 
235, british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there the lady at the gate worked the computer at miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do 
236, good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on j and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn t work 
237, flight was hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps 
238, london to istanbul british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about are considered as business class with very short leg space no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class check in while waiting for flights 
239, london to manchester british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude 
240, flight was cancelled at the last minute due to weather despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport hours ahead t horrendous check in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done 
241, after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not rows like last time but rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports 
242, this review is for ba booking system not a flight today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to cancel booking and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didn t want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they can t tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they can t say when so they now have my money and i have to re book at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up 
243, manchester to seattle via london i will never fly ba again they cancelled my return flight from heathrow back to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night i will not be flying ba again
244, our flight in march from san francisco to london on th march was cancelled with hours notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on follow ups it is the usual min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to re schedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were re bookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama 
245, i sat in seat c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways 
246, full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well 
247, i was told i d require a hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via ba com with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience 
248, having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and can t walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist it s not their fault it s the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the offer of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities it s just not worth the risk of travelling with ba 
249, i am a business class customer british airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date would not work they attempted to charge me additional for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything if you try to reach out no chance 
250, barbara collins was super helpful my boyfriend i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later one barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together even managed to put us sitting together much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks nibbles were great staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba 
251, my husband parents who are in their s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job 
252, on our recommendation my son and his young family child and baby months and wife flew ba to the usa from cape town leaving yesterday evening just got off the call with him after their arrival at heathrow shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided or not especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for years of business flights from rsa this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday my grandson had a coughing fit so they asked bell push times for glass of water all ignored last one was told wait till drinks are served then when evening meal served no food available for the year old which was pre ordered online they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre ordered the cabin staff supervisors response prove it sir that sealed it for us if that s the ba response to what s seen as cattle class it will permeate to our normal travel class so our next booking will be an alternate 
253, we had a nice flight pushed off exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things friendly for the most part as well dinner hot and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferent non helpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a week trip to england 
254, holidays ruined suitcases lost in flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we couldn t take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam one of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was days ago and we still don t have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they didn t allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam suitcases different flights they ve ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i get my property back no information lies and more lies i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the money back in days yes i might 
255, despite ba s promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications including to the chief executive have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba 
256, refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october which is months now i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to email protected several times and all they tell me is it s been processed british airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on till today i have not received my refund i am just wondering what is happening 
257, customer service is non existent for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on ba com i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly my sister and husband had tickets on the july from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sister s ticket not once but twice it took almost weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken hearted sister the price was plus a service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husband my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within seconds was told there was a increase british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply don t convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company
258, flight on a sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall 
259, for this hour min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone or like me you can pre order weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again 
260, my wife and i booked a flight in april that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on line which we hadn t done we were instructed to come back in hrs and mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at pm mins before our scheduled pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told we d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay pounds to go through fast track security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage space issues on the plane our flight arrived in london mns late and after going to the flight connections we were told mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of there isn t enough time that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check in area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the check in counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the check in line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured i d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying more days in a hotel just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim on line this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk 
261, decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on th june from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly hours we received a cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where employees working and a people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only line desks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat at some point after hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn t sleep stay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims refund process is non responsive as we already requested information times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight 
262, reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn t sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate 
263, three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three hour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic check in and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of check in staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone check in agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a half full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three hour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor 
264, routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine 
265, over week ago i cancelled club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further bookings with ba planned for the rest of i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare 
266, flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a star rating and have them again 
267, check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we don t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight 
268, washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost one day one day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here 
269, nairobi to new york via london british airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call back within hours i call every days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more money on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier big mistake
270, today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from check in through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husband s nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were bags checked and on the plane i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the out of was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on ba com which we did at this time about hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now i ve had bags not get on flights before less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info e g your bag was loaded onto the plane your bag is on its way to baggage claim ba doesn t seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadn t flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again 
271, british airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no one to check in flights departing within minutes of each other hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate 
272, i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid to reserve two seats on our own in a configuration cabin as i didn t want to sit in a row of people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of the email also stated that if i wasn t happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could get a full refund of the money i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable 
273, departure was about minutes late the a we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife s meal but no one responds better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport 
274, was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didn t even know it was cancelled someone behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all 
275, second time getting poor service from ba st unable to contact via phone email or website nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course no one at the airport could do anything 
276, booked a flight from london to paris trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as would not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does anyone have any other options re complaints we would be most grateful really not fair to just take our money 
277, we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not but flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over hour a total of extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle flight only problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we re unable to be helped ba cost me overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates don t be fooled 
278, the flight was delayed over hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways 
279, terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to check in my carry on suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after days they delivered of our bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i don t recommend at all 
280, ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldn t book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees i was booked onto a flight with ba for april th from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldn t find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking i d get a full refund i was refunded about of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldn t fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didn t get a full refund each phone call takes about minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about phone calls later thats hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more in total less than of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website just for an answer as to why i wasn t getting a full refund i didn t cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation we re sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on april your claim s been refused because ba was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i don t know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company 
281, belfast to london on jun i was informed at about flight ba has been delayed to will only reach london heathrow at i reached the airport at but ba counter was only open at at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at on the same day the reply was it is the customer s responsibility to contact the airline there s nothing we can do i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from i have to called another number for urgent cases which ever number i dial i just couldn t get to speak to any one till again i was told that there s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that it s the customer s responsibility to do it on their own i would think twice to take ba in the future 
282, the customer service of british airways is really bad you can t reach any call centre agent even after waiting for mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing ba s low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldn jnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with do co for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from do co overall my rating is for ba you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew
283, ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing 
284, this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus helpful and friendly fa minuses the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat even the fa found it difficult the in flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i don t know what the business class offerings from ba s rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia 
285, as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at for a departure mins later late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they don t hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last years the food standards and choices in the t first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short h m flight was a light dinner tray only choices by row with passengers in club europe only salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given menus for customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while do co supply this the do co meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip 
286, right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within hours and we didn t so far it will be at least days 
287, i could very much understand losing my luggage for days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag s location the man on the phone verbatim stated and if i don t after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was not his problem before saying hold and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjet nor is this westjet s luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before 
288, the a is a wonderful aircraft quieter than any other aircraft i ve flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost minutes at london terminal for baggage to arrive excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba 
289, lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers pushback delayed by lack of tug club suite seats k k a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to get through immigration 
290, covid form is broken called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone hour flight delay was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba 
291, feels like ba are putting the economy back in premium economy very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this already delayed pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew could come back later if you wanted something else including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldn t leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food i ve never experienced this on other airlines premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after we d eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under equipped under staffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable in flight entertainment was great and the screens large unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens brightness levels reset to their retina searing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly check in queue at cancun took forever couldn t see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative ba s problems all seem so easy to fix their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why aren t they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point 
292, phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a hour layover in heathrow bags didn t make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead end no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible check in desk other baggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again 
293, worst airline experience ever flew people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had exchanged tickets after hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also hours late then they lost our luggage days later they still don t have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a minute to hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them 
294, the crew ba on june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew i ve ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed 
295, i travelled on the th april with my baby in economy class flight ba and ba i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this 
296, outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didn t matter the crew made the flight outstanding 
297, recent trip to boston departing lhr t ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density layout in economy compared to the abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro actively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro actively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by do co was exceptional i don t think i ve eaten so much on a trans atlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out station overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again 
298, my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment 
299, as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the company s recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhr lhr on a miles ticket in february when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn t bothered to respond at the rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake 
300, boarding on time but unfortunately from ort s worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond ba s control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the was showing it s age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight 
301, flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than hours rechecking our bags took hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline 
302, check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar and finding the flight was delayed by nearly hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for hour flight no leg room on isle seat of the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice coca cola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from to so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again 
303, british airways travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline 
304, business class seating shown as a x configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to options by row out of in business class and by row where we were seated only one of us had options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class 
305, we arrived and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced 
306, ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesn t work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in hours 
307, i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldn t as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she didn t have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now 
308, when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over hours to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by minutes they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was i originally paid for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again 
309, another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wi fi was erratic and guests couldn t order food or drinks then the card payment system didn t work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case we caused the plane to go unbalanced really it s all one excuse after another with ba these days 
310, basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights cant check in could check in online or via the app customer service is non existent busy line after min still no one there to help me check in 
311, very low standards for club europe there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket no in flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best 
312, this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing than in the old b or even than in the b seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy 
313, british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust 
314, on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the come out of my account the next day as i m adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking i m not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again i m extremely frustrated 
315, amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation 
316, i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin more legroom upon check in my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am and not deaf sometimes they would purposely hang up before i said anything other times they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they would hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle 
317, we are on our way home after a week holiday in the uk and have had all flights with british airways our internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didn t realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal overall it took us about hours to get me checked in after speaking to about different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed kg and the bag was kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect 
318, i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight 
319, i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit 
320, we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the th april check in was very fast and we cleared security in about minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways
321, i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost k extra to change our return flight for the family to get a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost hours later there was no option to get any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure 
322, business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers 
323, our good friday flight was delayed by hours std atd to durban south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply didn t know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service 
324, we had a trip with flights included all flights were delayed the worst with h min also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a h earlier flight loosing h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really bad experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels 
325, my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly 
326, i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on th april zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal on ba april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british airways partner at pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied if it is so important why don t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience 
327, we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again 
328, the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn t good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
329, total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i wouldn t mind but on european trips in ba are charging up to times the fare levels of and the overall value for money is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings 
330, shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day 
331, i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked as they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again 
332, the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer across but this layout still squeezes in across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after take off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this take off was just after hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline 
333, a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience 
334, british airways is the most terrible airline i ve dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can t make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you can t check in online the application sucks so much you re better off trying to code your own app and it ll probably work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can t verify your documents yet the app and website say you re verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won t work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again 
335, british airways is the most terrible airline i ve ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can t make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we d booked with our year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers 
336, ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought i d buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived mins earlier than scheduled what s not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once 
337, new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didn t once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba 
338, very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly 
339, ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldn t be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on time including having business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us 
340, flew back on ba bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites the end of this awful yin and yang seating can t come soon enough even tried to pay ba s extortionate pre booking rate for our seats none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle seats of e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though ba s policy has changed regarding flying back to a non mask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast fairly dire my wife s smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good it s really good but when it s bad it s awful i recommend hesitatingly come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats 
341, the worst budget airline i ve ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though they re basically free ba charge about x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over hours because they couldn t connect to the internet then left of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone s flights if they waited another mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us s then on return i ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there s no sign of our luggage again i don t know how a company can be this incompetent but i ll be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i won t be using them because it s not worth going through this again 
342, first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all flights zrh lhr gva lhr lhr zrh first in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrh lhr impossible to check in online and just staff to check in everyone for flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gva lhr hrs late as no one at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhr zrh mins late due to slow gate staff even when you check in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard getting to be onboard 
343, have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wi fi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be 
344, flew to barbados march on ba in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fa s called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the in flight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown the usual extortionate fee charged for pre booking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats 
345, very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case 
346, our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst we ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again 
347, complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at am today was over hour and subsequent flight to malaga hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays times but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for years since bea boac days 
348, feb we show up at the airport hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldn t let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days it s declined we have asked for a contact just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passive aggressive messages they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from 
349, british airways are in the process of upgrading all its fleet to the new club suite but ba had the yrs old packed like sardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical time saving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy it s hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow 
350, we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldn t check in online we arrive at heathrow hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just desks open for a queue of approx travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadn t simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful and took the best part of hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husband s vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though i d previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didn t want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy 
351, absolutely bad experience with british airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first one i understand covid unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them 
352, flew ba lhr aus on a on the outbound leg and then back on the a on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhr aus route lhr aus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time aus lhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number in line and waited for hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form s ready verifly app ready and or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline i would not fly ba 
353, the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown s such rubbish on ba 
354, i really can t believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so they re using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean it s first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so we re in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally i m happy in club and would never do first again 
355, london to dubai family of kids where from down to years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought we ll get something usually around hour into the flight hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as you d expect from many other airlines even a kids book would be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience 
356, one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may yes the weekend of the last but one it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug to bologna ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb th received a message am mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to get one of the last seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop soon ran out of seats by midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron had a consistent queue of about people as ba were still cancelling rearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to reconcile luggage when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five hour flight they purport to be a top class airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline 
357, we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhr mle wasn t too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasn t a good experience we weren t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in business first actually i think ba only care about the business first customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice rows back in our cabin it s not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we weren t fed until hrs before we landed it was a hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing slices or cucumber and slices of tomato ba just don t care anymore about the little people 
358, british airways is getting worse an worse my flight was mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive no communication whatsoever from anyone they can t be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do 
359, paid for business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldn t even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again 
360, absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen food drink order to be brought to me ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average 
361, our flight back to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline what s worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again 
362, flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of ham cheese for breakfast after a hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last 
363, there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over contact attempts spanning hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised weeks ago 
364, the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about passengers but business class was three quarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take off on schedule sadly ba makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba there are some good points about the old club world the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat but other than those it s an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious post covid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but it s a lacklustre experience in contrast to ba s competitors and smacks of continued cost cutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage 
365, british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full x seats because of it issue the day before even if weren t the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they don t any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful 
366, outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes 
367, british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba from london to malaga on th february and across visible rows around me there were out of passengers wearing face masks and i was one of them this was long after the meal drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules 
368, for once more ba got it all wrong with hours delay food voucher of pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity 
369, another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via ba s website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a were a disgrace 
370, check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t arrivals lounge which was excellent 
371, very old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable 
372, having just booked ba for a return flight being one hour each way in club class and paying euro for persons to be then asked to pay a further euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model 
373, ba got everything right allowed evening before check in this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done
374, appalling customer service they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the telephone with no response or you just get a recorded message to say they can t take the call they don t respond to emails sent to the complaints line 
375, this past november december i flew washington london return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre pandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to re book a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my re bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances that s to be expected it s good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and i m looking forward to future trips on ba 
376, i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about minutes before i could speak with someone and within minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on i ll definitely make sure to check with british airways first 
377, ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again 
378, boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air con at the gate the club suite cabins were about full but the rest of the plane can t have been much more than occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take off which is a real bonus on a night time flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats don t significantly aid sleeping particularly as there s an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight 
379, unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the bad was the in flight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wife s didn t and post ipad era just don t live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff i m afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels 
380, utterly appalling company we ve flown with them two times now and both times it s been a disaster the first time return flight was delayed by over hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we couldn t choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i didn t get a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba don t even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible 
381, over the past years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had to staff ran a kiosk queue of over unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now hours and all i got from the guest services was a food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing 
382, return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from to and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at with departure at minutes late drinks service only started minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
383, i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club check in and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew was in and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys 
384, i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hard earned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises 
385, i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as i ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub par service i understand that it s been a tough two years for airlines but ba s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba check in terminal even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they d miss their flights terrible efficiency at the check in counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn t pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like i m clinging on to my airline status which doesn t actually provide you a better service these days 
386, the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn t work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline 
387, straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the self serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and should ve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didn t with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what you d expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards 
388, on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the check in desks luggage drop and check in was appalling it took us over hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one check in desk for euro traveller club europe one for bag drop and one for the check in flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport 
389, in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant i used the ba lounge in terminal not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t to t we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another hrs mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes it s not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time i ve never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is 
390, after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats k and k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yin yang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn t dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back 
391, i paid for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me i d be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me i d be getting back which is less than half of the i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded i emailed again and they told me i d be getting more back when i emailed again saying that that doesn t add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with that s the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of and i was only getting total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they ve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me 
392, very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as passengers don t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing i think it is great that they also have food alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t arrivals is a breeze 
393, overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of well presented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdg lhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead it s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was one way return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money 
394, first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless the crew were nice so sorry i missed that 
395, flying during covid is always a challenge ba s verifly app worked perfectly and on line check in was seamless the bags drop at t was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed 
396, flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on is seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba 
397, i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t is a mess with minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame 
398, we ve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better in flight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being minutes early was rewarded with a minute wait for a gate then a hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times 
399, my flight yesterday was due to take off at soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre boarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day 
400, it is first time we have flown ba business class in a aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the check in and crew were great friendly and helpful it was manual check in not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and choices for main course business class seating is with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner s legs not some stranger i am ft and could just about manage my wife at ft could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible 
401, i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per e mail and i still didn t get a reply it has been months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service 
402, british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all 
403, i have a flight booked for january they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i don t even get an apology just cancel 
404, i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home i d been under the impression that it was a simple process just call up and book onto the same route that i d previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines i d redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that s just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over weeks on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day around hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though i ve flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has gone significantly downhill 
405, extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as flt was changed to a hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british airways had rebooked with delta this took about mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated 
406, british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the am flight from t at heathrow to paris cdg on nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk 
407, i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at pm for a pm departure there was no staff until and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger 
408, check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m not the airlines fault replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a neo went ahead the club europe cabin was rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at tall i can fit ok however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not ba s finest hour 
409, arrived at the south airport in tenerife hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a neo with rows of club seating the seat was ok for a hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch s between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew 
410, check in very slow no app check in and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row even worse crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba landed at no gate so waited and waited for minutes then ba jetty didn t work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable 
411, after h queuing at the check in desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have 
412, outbound seated in row i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherd s pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier as if ba could not get a better one on the return boarding from the back not by priority then seated in row i had the last half glass of champagne only because one of the other passengers in row had declined food was rigatoni with vegetables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful not for us again 
413, flew club europe london tenerife south november and returned november club europe seats are not comfortable you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not pre book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights both in a new or nearly near a both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become 
414, hours standing in line for boarding pass airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst 
415, i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because i m flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online i ve tried live chat several times and waited hours only to be told there s no one available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line someone immediately picks up of course however they can t help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn t deserve to be a national airline i haven t had these problems at all and i ve been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately it s been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i don t even speak spanish 
416, this whole experience was sickening over grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option 
417, poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around passengers including me had to wait from am until am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba 
418, currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called live chat all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldn t change the name told me that we should ve done the booking more carefully well you re going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello it s the st century you should have a button saying change name anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn t making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said thanks for your help i ll deal with it la got cut off minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck 
419, another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery 
420, flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left minutes late but made up time en route there were rows to the business class cabin on this a service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered it s a long sector and the food wasn t great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if i m being honest when we ve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about 
421, upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the u k much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day test uploading it onto our plf s verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check in he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba 
422, club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz 
423, good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a gate at lhr t so we were bussed to the plane first time i ve used a bus gate there the a was at t at a gate with a jetway nevertheless passengers full flight boarded via steps this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the baggage taking ages also the seat recline on g gatl f is broken 
424, usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it s not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value 
425, check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
426, what has happened to british airways the whole pre flight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise it s due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they can t even open all the desks so for passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace i ve chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me k of spending to earn so that tells you how much i ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year i ve booked ba flights personal and business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries of the have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for weeks that cost me my holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they won t extend the voucher i m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline i m not even going to bother using my second voucher and i ve cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed who d have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option 
427, i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much 
428, the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in k to begin with i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight 
429, the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight 
430, i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows to were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didn t fully recline unlike the seats in rows to i was in row this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba mis selling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldn t have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i don t know how they get away with it 
431, terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldn t go still can t go as borders are still closed i wasn t given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still haven t been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be i ve been such a good customer and feel i deserve better 
432, this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines check in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service seating was extremely uncomfortable inch pitch and inch wide seats just about bearable for an hour and a half flight on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers 
433, lca to lhr in club europe quick check in at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard w fi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldn t be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through e gates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the post covid standard for short haul business class 
434, i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday th august to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister s name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emails messages one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day 
435, we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didn t receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in flight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service 
436, the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing 
437, an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the gov uk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england 
438, i ve had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we d scheduled around hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldn t get us to our destination within hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment it s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment 
439, the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i can t give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and breakfast 
440, such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say whaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yes asked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously ba what are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly 
441, lhr to lca galleries lounge chock a block first thing on a wednesday morning and t seemed as bustling as pre pandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back rows the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch post covid lunch remains restricted do co must be horrified by what they re having to produce miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish i ve ever tasted wi fi access wasn t free for business class passengers for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca 
442, very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfast brunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbon madrid london who were cold and unprofessional 
443, no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for mins plus 
444, no refund for flights cancelled months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until april tickets bought on edreams on june for a flight on july from geneva to s o paulo through london british airways round trip the lhr gru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last months but they did not refund the euros that i paid 
445, stranded in the lounge because i wasn t allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didn t want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasn t available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options 
446, i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid travel flexibility really means because it doesn t pass the common sense test i purchased a round trip business class ticket from new york to and from mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we can t answer your call try again no ability to leave a call back number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a third party agent i did not i bought it on ba com and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new return flight to the u s i ve now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis booked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctor s note saying that i was sick then they ll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation 
447, my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience 
448, year after year the british airways ba service on the same route washington london is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july british airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from pm to pm so we had to spend an extra hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check uk gov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like times they are still giving us the run around 
449, ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flights get cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for plus minutes to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel 
450, the entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a short haul flight after flying with aeroflot and s airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think it s unacceptable for a non low cost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didn t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff 
451, i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands 
452, very efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early 
453, me and my year months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on august when we landed at heathrow my baby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping baby who is nearly kg and luggage bag another kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no one to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder i met no one whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all 
454, for this flight from heathrow t passengers were piled into the bus and left for mins at the terminal very unhappy passengers and when confronted the ba transport manager s response was sorry we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event 
455, ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check in this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don t seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight 
456, they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher 
457, i ve been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not interlude to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason with medical treatment being one i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so ba s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd lhr flights because who knows i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money i ve decided to avoid ba from now on 
458, check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time 
459, departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of minutes for luggage 
460, booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasn t ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they can t give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the phone 
461, the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a hours layover that s before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn t do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute 
462, i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned h and d called several times but they couldn t do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they didn t allow us to seat together 
463, i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat pre selection in biz class uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were ba s universally derided cramped across back to front configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm s length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasn t available even though there were only people in my seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest i ve ever seen in biz class it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket but of course got whacked with ba s unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of for using miles 
464, aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly it s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that check in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much pre packaging the covid effect presumably arrival into t was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the e gates and collecting our luggage just minutes after landing 
465, i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful 
466, after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t was blissfully quiet with no queues at check in or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnson s bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from one s table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just pax on board of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous groups service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual do co quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience 
467, ba cancelled flight in dec refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now months down the line calls of which each is min waiting time and email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises 
468, fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water it s a start 
469, boarding and disembarking were greatly organised passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved distribute hand sanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row business was overlooked for some reason after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba still it left some strange experience 
470, this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage check in this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i don t expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived minutes late 
471, ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight after having my return cancelled times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the e voucher and i would need to call up to rebook i m in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled times i wasn t offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way 
472, absolutely appalling experience british airways unfortunately has lowered it s standards and to my dismay i ve been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered i recently had my flight cancelled on occasions and the staff weren t interested in helping me return home 
473, had booked the above mentioned flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didn t notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for check in it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn t realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions didn t allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they didn t realise i couldn t fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i don t have any travel plans for the next two years that means my money is gone when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was onetravel the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn t allow them to take me a poor show with ba 
474, my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled times when i call to ba several times their computer system didn t work and they couldn t issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage as i couldn t pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i done it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost baggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they wouldn t compensate anything 
475, cancellations for month applying vouchers only to find out they don t work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to anyone in covid restrictions 
476, i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
477, i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly no lounge at all at mexico city terminal there s a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldn t help with the details mexico city terminal has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what you d expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where i d left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isn t offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really don t bother with first unless you have to or go to another airline the company just don t care 
478, charge fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative 
479, good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wi fi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic i m sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know 
480, i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mother s funeral with the flowers she was apologetic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight 
481, i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldn t get home i ve also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding i m not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba check in but unfortunately couldn t do it as my results didn t go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive i ve come to her times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady i ve ever met unfortunately i didn t catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i can t thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did lastly the nice lady shame i don t know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i haven t met them i don t know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in
482, dubai to london on th december flight was ok seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming back to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything not like the crew were busy either did services the whole flight then rest of the time didn t see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines 
483, this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are open limited hours flight on time and well presented a staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again 
484, i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my son s bottle didn t even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i would give emirates and british airways it s not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again 
485, overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing which i mean as constructive criticism though i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice that s fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received 
486, i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munich london city munich within working days in a friendly and professional manner the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways 
487, boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not pre ordered my flight was hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry 
488, i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didn t let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but it s still very good tasty lunch box from do co with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority 
489, we had a flight to santorini from lhr at am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at am and the queue for check in was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the check in had closed at am and that we had missed the flight british airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini would be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we would get nothing 
490, my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record s air history 
491, i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and ml of water it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for euros one was was available but it didn t seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean 
492, newcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well 
493, due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on th august and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours 
494, british airways canceled my flight to london on june due to covid it is july and they still have not refunded my money i ve reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british airways service is non existent and they will keep your money they are keeping almost us of our money 
495, london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better and weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasn t appeared in my account after days to get back in touch things go wrong it s how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasn t a clue 
496, ba cancelled my flight to lyon march april because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and telephone service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member phone number is inaccessible as ba has reduced telephone access to one number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as in these difficult times they had to protect staff this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their money this is appalling business practice 
497, a short hop from london to edinburgh in november efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from 
498, total rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic 
499, i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for people through the ba website paying us in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as we are not allowed to travel outside the us as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airb bs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and or vouchers i ve tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august st to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways 
500, i booked a trip to spain for mid march with american airlines british airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i would have been quarantined in europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re entry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to spain with the travel ban enforced the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i m very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them 
501, i booked london to tel aviv in jan to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional so i would fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to get and they deducted as a service fee for the upgrade calls and e mails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund 
502, i booked my honeymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my honeymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my would be wife this was more than in additional cost the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my would be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes i m very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again 
503, this company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was get a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you don t have voucher 
504, tokyo to london hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable it is all about money with them 
505, flight ba on february was delayed mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived hrs mins late i requested compensation and was refused for three e mails they told me my flight to london was delayed mins under the mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i don t know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence 
506, london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large high resolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the and 
507, my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the check in and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic but we flew out on one of ba s new a s and this brought home to me that the business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tail winds 
508, i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed it s borders so i could no longer get this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn t yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for hours and still no one answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didn t want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice when i got back home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an involuntary change to get a replacement flight that is not what the customer agent advised me i d never even heard that term before he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he didn t say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don t know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that wasn t good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything i will never use this airline again 
509, during the time of covid it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight i m ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things what s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher you can t use their voucher online or for a cheap flight on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even won t use my miles with ba 
510, do not accept a british airways e voucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted e vouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has money and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they don t have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you can t redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to phone them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after ba s approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future 
511, london heathrow to warsaw on th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with groups boarding sequentially i didn t try the paid marks spencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy 
512, just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can 
513, at check in desk at t heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eu efta eea uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while in flight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy 
514, i booked a flight with them on of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with someone no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus 
515, a journey of halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they weren t honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could re book and showed lots of flights none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better a total wait of hour minutes to make calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba weren t accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent as usual food was good verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for years because the head office is so poor the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed e g over securing client s data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba 
516, i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in holidays who said he couldn t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldn t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldn t do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid but never again ba 
517, very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid effectively holding onto my money illegally do what s right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a hour wait on the phone very disappointed i expect much better from you 
518, i booked my flights to the uk in may and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march and because i am older and have pre existing health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non refundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may for travel to the uk by may or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non refundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may this pandemic is over for all of us 
519, mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did 
520, i have a booking for march th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on march to state we re working closely with the foreign commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on march and it states the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal 
521, london gatwick to funchal british airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on march for a week s holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend days in quarantine no matter how long their stay that s a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble 
522, lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a bad joke to add insult to injury the amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed would retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this once great national airline is palpable 
523, london to new york jfk another grim flight with british airways in club class on a tired and old b the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats 
524, diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble 
525, frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying hrs the hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me 
526, london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line 
527, london city to berlin on th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled 
528, london to beijing in january ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like calls emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not ba s partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
529, hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again 
530, mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service 
531, london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next which given the size of the t check in hall wasn t helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude especially when we discovered we were seated separately it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored 
532, paris to london flight cancelled due to atc restrictions after storm ciara and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by hours arrived in london hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgw bgy lgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfrance klm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame 
533, i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving february on february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldn t help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight ba s complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again 
534, gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays there s unfortunately not much difference between ba easyjet flight left gatwick late arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to get worse 
535, vancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b is showing its age but it s still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and i ll continue to prefer it over the b 
536, i am flying london to seattle in business class in may and british airways wants around each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasons s what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat without asking me what i get is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up 
537, london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t to cram first class seats onto a is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flag carrier represents britain so badly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because ba s business class is so poor but never again 
538, dubai to london my husband and i traveled together he got business class my ticket was a last minute add on so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husband came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didn t and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasn t ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and i ll show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow i located my husband in the business class apparently his seat had extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it 
539, london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba 
540, rio de janeiro to london economy packed out seating awful food very narrow seats uncomfortable expensive add ons seat choice luggage try to match norwegian pricing on the rio route ife was iffy my back and legs have been terrible for days i paid for an exit seat the breakfast served was unfit for me i took my own drinks and some food items long haul is getting the same as short come prepared 
541, johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes 
542, las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the was the most uncomfortable flight in business class i ve experienced the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of that s a tight squeeze and there were backward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didn t pay full price for this flight 
543, ba cancelled my return flight on feb from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight i ve tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them 
544, mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn t actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely they re always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever 
545, london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a cabins although unfortunately without any in seat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in seat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient pre flight experience at heathrow s excellent t fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a ft chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints 
546, i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july arriving late to board my heathrow flight the check in staff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to get to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled 
547, madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in or to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money don t waste your money on this 
548, prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the check in partly the website s fault as we had done the online check in we selected the amount of bags we each had it said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay for each bag apart from those negatives and the delay i would definitely fly this airline again 
549, johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and i ve given up expecting anything more from ba s business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside minutes after landing reliability is currently ba s strongest card 
550, las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight i ve paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the pre order card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same i m used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so i m used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semi reclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasn t quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all s wooden panels 
551, san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non core routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said holiday inn there are about in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldn t talk to me because i failed security i didn t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a hour layover from am to pm getting me home over hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to exceptionally change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class who knows how they treat economy passengers 
552, cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious wine dispensing machines boarding was quick and take off was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was minutes ahead of schedule 
553, on th of december before my flight s departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasn t allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i haven t had any food for the whole day as i didn t have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you 
554, phoenix to london since moving to the usa i ve been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you won t be disappointed with club world 
555, london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for hour flight i know they re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy 
556, mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you can t carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston hrs after i had come even after contacting ba s baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience 
557, i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british airways only gave me the seats i paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british airways to get my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of despite several phone calls and filing multiple on line calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again 
558, toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the was generous and seemed to be more than the official pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on long haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacific s is far superior the two major downsides the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on long haul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickle and dimed i d fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check in is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at check in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely no complimentary catering on short haul seeing as virtually all passengers flying to from heathrow are connecting to from long haul flights with ba and have spent at least on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short haul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines 
559, hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights i ve had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best i ve experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight 
560, san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row k j with their bags and blankets i would not recommend ba or the 
561, singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a hour flight hour stopover and hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than hours after arrival meaning out of days in paris will be spent without luggage 
562, warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft it s important to choose a seat no further than row in a neo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in ba s executive club you can pay for the food drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag check in at warsaw airport opened check in counters for approx people is rather not enough 
563, new york to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline 
564, london to los angeles take off was delayed by hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids sitting on bulkhead with seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back days later conclusion never fly ba again 
565, british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comair s idiosyncratic four course meal i e a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule 
566, london to bangkok it s not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at lhr and mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as bad my most recent experience was early january when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the hours long haul flight together however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep 
567, london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by mph gusts but once away the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats j k are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just minutes after landing overall a good flight 
568, overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing to a boeing which is known as the queen of the skies the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom ba need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing and boeing if they still plan to use them on longer flights 
569, los angeles to london on th january and my husbands seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience 
570, gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was bad and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how 
571, fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airway s club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed on time and landed minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the in flight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been ever so slightly more leg room and in flight entertainment i d have given this flight a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline 
572, rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a class business world traveller plus and economy class cabins in business class front rows and rear rows i had seat a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side j k i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed 
573, gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats i encountered odd problems with the meal as well the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the best inflight w fi service for pounds you get unlimited very high speed wi fi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts 
574, keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after hours on the ground waiting for the di icing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them non alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the de icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take off how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can t fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done 
575, fly economy and you ll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible 
576, my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tv s stopped working mid flight also for a period of minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service 
577, london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wife s remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasn t allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wife s when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a job s worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer 
578, los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service i ve flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets months in advance to ensure that our family flew hour flight together the flight to london didn t have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class i ve flown the check in process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them 
579, istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving m s food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic 
580, london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through i was seated on row and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from one row to the other h before take off cost me an additional gbp 
581, london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at a b but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food pre ordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didn t really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight 
582, london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they don t provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly 
583, copenhagen to london super slow had to wait for buses which were delayed also packed the buses to tight with people where too far from arrival terminals service bad from staff coming to terminal is the worst terminal on heathrow the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff 
584, budapest to billund return via london on and dec a aircrafts check in in budapest had a narrow timeslot of hours before departure with long queues i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer hold a gold card with qatar airways at check in and had to struggle to get bags accepted as inscribed luggage i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr there is no oneworld lounge in budapest so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways for ba i do not have status in london granted access to any oneworld lounge onboard food and drinks with hefty price tags water is not free flights were full but on time i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive luggage delivered perfectly return trips legs were both full flights but departed slightly early granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t in london loads of good hot foods and good beers and wines onboard there is no ife no seat recline mediocre not cheap but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding 
585, i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights 
586, sydney to toulouse via singapore london boeing and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tls lhr sector a celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a g t hit the spot you could argue it should be free but i m not complaining i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines you re still pretty good 
587, sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient 
588, my husband and i had a wonderful flight to barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble josey and her team were made the the journey amazing having flown with virgin for many years i can say it s night and day tank you your staff are amazing we will be british airways in the future many thanks 
589, london to munich ba on december delayed by mins dated not very clean a boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggage turns out plane is half empty no complementary drinks and snacks will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economy never again 
590, hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didn t match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan igot in contact with bas executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her 
591, my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged times for one bag after i was assured charges didn t go through have been trying to get a refund from ba since they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged times for one bag only months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didn t owe me any money they force you to communicate via email and then don t respond they owe me usd and refuse to give me my money at this point 
592, new york to london i was on the last flight out at pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects the boeing certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier i m a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two 
593, austin to london along with an purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba 
594, frankfurt to london with british airways awful airline put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together gave me middle seat even though many others were free a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you don t book biz class avoid 
595, london to glasgow with british airways flight is again delayed it s not like it s a one off as it s delayed every week like a bad joke really a poor yet very expensive airline who i wouldn t recommend to any traveller 
596, london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldn t be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of world s favourite airline the has seen better days however given they re being removed from most airline s passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before they re gone i m gradually regaining my confidence in ba 
597, heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the flight to belfast on th december 
598, london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flight s service was very average and quite sloppy but let s focus on the positives 
599, toulouse to london i m a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat i d put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline 
600, london heathrow to stockholm business class short haul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the g t and good food 
601, johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again 
602, johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it there s more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasn t at all bad when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasn t too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product 
603, london heathrow to miami flying the boeing unfortunately ba hasn t done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my makes the beds small and since it s so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable 
604, stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent g t and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the s economy they taste great 
605, london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when re boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for hour min nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over ft tall 
606, london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about ba s to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and well deserved reputation never again 
607, the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren t any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didn t get any better after one hour minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing 
608, brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on nov seats c and d it was a boeing with a seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy class like the service is very friendly but not personal i m used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running the breakfast is good yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight 
609, san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight hours minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for gbp 
610, i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin minutes late 
611, london to johannesburg with british airways ba s b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal it s also a tad closer on the transit or via the rather useful walkway on level to the c gates where the a s depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average 
612, london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on november was delayed by hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for mins announcement was made the flight was delayed hrs mins due to maintenance 
613, london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening st november they spent nearly hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight ba singapore to sydney november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well 
614, lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again 
615, ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and i m sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger s are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en route from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence i m very disappointed with the service they provide 
616, doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation 
617, london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to get up and walk around during the hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush toothpaste etc no such offerings 
618, san francisco to london a is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button mid flight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for minutes i don t see how that is acceptable 
619, sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy 
620, london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline 
621, los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much 
622, london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered this then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostess host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normal newish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phone s no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul 
623, the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn t know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to ba s incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline 
624, london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a nudge before it was delivered not a great club europe experience 
625, london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back 
626, tirana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wi fi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wi fi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this hours minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de boarded quickly i always recommend ba and will continue to do so 
627, gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service 
628, london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one 
629, london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible i m only and female but couldn t lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the a c both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights it s not worth it 
630, gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied 
631, bordeaux to gatwick british airways cancelled my september flight due to the pilots strike with advance notice i made alternative travel arrangements confirmed that i wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund and received confirmation from ba on august ba refunded my fare soon enough but i am still awaiting a refund for the euro cost of baggage that i paid six weeks later i lodged a complaint on th october no action i lodged another complaint on th october and still no action they cancelled my flight and won t refund my money and they call it customer service 
632, seychelles to london day time flight back to london staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats j k best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle on time departure and swift meal services nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on seat and screens worked great and no problems i loved every minute of the flight a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic looking forward to my next flight to rio in december
633, london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats c and d on arrival at check in one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at check in started quoting the geneva convention that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary don t trust ba with your loved ones care 
634, london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy ba s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again 
635, san jose to london the tv screen of f was broken could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the back of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husband in e and me turned in the breakfast cards together the flight attendant insisted they don t have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed 
636, london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy 
637, flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly 
638, we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth 
639, i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive hour minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we can t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about hour and minutes of wait
640, zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are empty rows either side of strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink 
641, san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints 
642, london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process i e by group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba 
643, london gatwick to salzburg with british airways worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told it s not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home 
644, frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be done far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities 
645, hyderabad to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details bank address etc required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary 
646, vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a hours trip no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better 
647, london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrival departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at pm and took off at stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes additional seats are replacing the toilets located at the back of the and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price 
648, brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators 
649, my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back i never saw the crew member again 
650, kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said like an ipa i answered yes i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me 
651, london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great a b good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already pre ordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after hours of sleep
652, edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over it took minutes before my bag came through the baggage claim service desk turned away other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn t for another days hoping that british airways would help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent basically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost for new tickets to get home spent the next hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again 
653, amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at am local time and arrives in only hours to london this is a very good product 
654, london to athens british airways is a glorified budget airline a hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an m s inflated price sandwich is the meal no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in yet they charged full service airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided 
655, terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food i will never fly british airways again stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline 
656, buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money 
657, mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service it s almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights 
658, great all round ba october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldn t ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich 
659, flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag 
660, flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline 
661, johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at pm the following night at pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported hours previously finally departed at pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking 
662, dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i don t know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product 
663, istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch 
664, yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service 
665, flight from london to athens with british airways was one of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have gone no frills and airline has become a bad quality budget airline sad avoid 
666, short minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time 
667, calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn t be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips 
668, for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to it s poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it s customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again 
669, austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel you re in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect 
670, london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement separate toilets from economy dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service a better nd meal the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again yes definitely 
671, i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is hr my flight layover in london was hr min british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering minutes more than london s minimum hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a no frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise 
672, one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba don t tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don t warn of limited facilities it doesn t help that the flight is delayed by an hour 
673, gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight sept i gave ba almost out of across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldn t have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork 
674, vancouver to london great flight on the superb a in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended 
675, gatwick to alicante hours hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last months vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under ft tall 
676, we have had some torrid experiences with ba which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then it s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the world s favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesn t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic 
677, london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight we ve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn t do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that 
678, i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded of the i had paid the difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the i never received the refund 
679, the start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by minutes once airborne in a refitted a complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadn t extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight and a first for me was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast although at a cost of for an hour s use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport minutes later so not too bad all in all 
680, chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at pm chicago time but was scheduled at pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at pm we managed to board on the a for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at pm we had to wait hours for boarding for another minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a at pm zurich time instead of the original pm very stressful at least the staff were nice 
681, glasgow to london smooth flight departure arrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had pre ordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadn t provided any so they said but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight 
682, having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the check in and security clearance at t took only minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system to which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again i m not a fan of this possibly due to the previous day s strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room i m m cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only border police carrying out immigration controls for over passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further minute wait for luggage but this was not ba s fault 
683, i wouldn t even rate them x business class passengers booked via on business bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds ok that s a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhr mxp for days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering e voucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again 
684, flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline yet it charges full service prices 
685, los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge it took us min to find two chairs to seat food was awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of plus fee change so we ended up paying per person in addition to the fare already paid 
686, phoenix to tel aviv via london the return from london to phoenix was a nightmare i want everyone to know that i sent a complaint times but there is no one to talk to this is not something that i am used to 
687, london to kefalonia the t galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting minutes in a queue and then minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that we d be waiting on a stand for hr minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport minutes later overall a typical ba experience that s lacklustre at best 
688, london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my bag did not make it on the flight i then flew with british airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using american s baggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession ba s customer service is terrible if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city i m in for more than a day and i can t get it talk about serious frustration i don t know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around unfortunately she couldn t get hold of anyone but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told we are not authorized to call airports why in the world wouldn t they be authorized to call their own baggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a bag and it s lost or delayed don t expect any help if you flew with ba and here s a tip if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don t live in don t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will get a lot more information and assistance that way 
689, hong kong to london an email on the th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home 
690, gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay gbp because one of the suitcases was cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight 
691, london to abuja flight full aircraft an older version of evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja return flight delayed pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos and had to be flown back to abuja with a hour delay flight was supposed to be a am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow full credit to the crew cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the floor was visible 
692, london to bangkok what an awful plane seats are just about ok going coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat really uncomfortable the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about films rubbish took hours to get the screens to actually work the plane looks old and tired not a pleasure to travel on this plane 
693, belfast to san francisco via london check in at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed with in just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request the galleries lounge in terminal at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and would recommend british airways 
694, london to gothenburg ba are getting a lot of bad press deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches baggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a pushed back m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a on time departure and early arrival at t again good crew will be flying with ba again in december strikes permitting still recommended by me as the national carrier 
695, orlando to gatwick terrible flight experience bed bugs in old club world seats missed meals poor service complaints is outsourced to a german company who aren t even part of ba do not fly ba and club world is a waste of money 
696, mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about minutes don t know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasn t especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didn t ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a so tight 
697, glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at boarded with doors closed by bug did not depart till due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience 
698, orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar only one drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service 
699, london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihad s disastrous changes in food service the children s meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why don t you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad 
700, london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to over the last years from at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was half empty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the money 
701, sydney to london via singapore with british airways i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes and maybe other vegetables i am not sure for one meal and an ice cold frittata sandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took one bite and couldn t continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class with the price difference to match of course the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights paid for in flight wifi for an a hour disconnected after minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed 
702, london to johannesburg british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically yes that s the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers don t charge nearly the high fees and most don t charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware 
703, i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as i ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience 
704, i had a stress free journey with my yr old autistic son and yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport happyautism thank you
705, edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday th august at i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i didn t quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey one of the best on board experiences i have had 
706, i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on business class once at lcy my early pm flight appeared as cancelled a state of confusion broke out at the airport with people trying to find alternatives however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight on a busy day i waited for hours at the airport the new flight was displayed as delayed for mins the delay kept on increasing with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after pm i kept on waiting the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well result half a day wasted at lcy i feel that ba s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately delays and cancellations can happen however i have been flying ba times a year and the of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately especially to from amsterdam and germany also the customer service seems to have a minimum care proposition provide what is strictly required by the law only if customers complain taking as long as possible that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer whether you are a frequent flyer or not 
707, i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british airways for feb on the day of travel a few hours before the departure time i realized that i would not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation when i arrived home i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund i understood that my ticket was a non refundable one but it says on the ticket that surcharges taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least euro however all the airline refunded me was a pitiful euro i have been trying to speak to british airways on twitter many times over the past few months and they never responded positively only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change british airways is being dishonest and should be avoided 
708, london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great 
709, i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help i recently flew to london from chicago they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you they do not you can t find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you 
710, good morning i would like to write a review for british airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my year old son and my year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight back i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the phone they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible 
711, my flight was cancelled days in a row was flying out on thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with ba i got a flight out saturday night with swiss air they on the other hand actually fly and on time everything about the customer service customer relations has been terrible hours of waiting on the phone no answers on email my other flights with ba this year has been delayed too they have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of first days then bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet so far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to caa and the danish aviation authority 
712, hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air b b house in marstal in cph on or before rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on th august on nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to th august instead of and we could not correct it by ourselves on rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at pm on the th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldn t find our luggage and the staff didn t explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the th how come it would disappear on the th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you can t imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage that s how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day of our trip 
713, london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of business class but of the seats did not operate no headphones socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel 
714, inflight crew were very helpful polite and caring though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines it was quite pleasant the food and drink selection was pretty basic however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding upon approaching the ba counter the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain neither any empathy nor any willingness to help 
715, from toronto to pisa british airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family people ranging from to years from terminal to terminal escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we would have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived minutes before the time 
716, a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a to and airbus a we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probably because the plane was relatively new the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios it isn t that bad as it was only to europe an overall very good experience on board this flight 
717, this was the worst experience i have ever had flying there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our bags from american airlines aa verified that they delivered the bags to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london the bags did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our bags i left a earphone hard case on the plane but your lost and found never answered to file a claim your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing on the return flight from london to newark your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock with an experience like this on our first vacation to london i would do everything to never fly british airways again 
718, london to larnaca new a neo hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my money the staff was friendly but spending money on a hour flight on such a small plane doesn t worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration 
719, gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and ba s check in at orlando was quick and easy 
720, london to munich the plane is a the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided 
721, london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on 
722, the seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines the seats are aging and uncomfortable the forward backward configuration is the most stupid i have seen the cabin had seats to a row and about people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck hours ahead of the flight 
723, no problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways 
724, malaga to london heathrow a shambolic airline rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga ba sent warning of the hour delay just before the late boarding began sophisticated it setup they have club europe meal remains a big cutback from despite what ba claim cabin staff were bored from the start and despite serving in club cabin the service was very poor arrived heathrow at and then sat waiting mins for ground staff to show up simply appalling trip and truly ripped off 
725, sydney to singapore extremely disappointed trip they are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure many important things are in the checked baggage and we ll have further trip later on which affected us badly no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
726, london heathrow to inverness having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on after short notice cancellation which i had to wait over a day for was also cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go eventually got off the plane to utter chaos mixed messages being given by ground crew some people given details about rebooking others given nothing some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels however some people were only given one bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers utterly appalling now i m hoping against hope i might make it home today days after setting off 
727, heathrow to glasgow again flight is delayed it s easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff don t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service 
728, a supremely awful experience from beginning to end flight to vancouver delayed by hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between only told once on board what the problem was delays at baggage reclaim meant i didn t get out of vancouver airport until after midnight originally scheduled to arrive pm this affected a camping trip the booking for which could not be changed flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane due to it faults none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the hour flight food was awful and we got a choice of one meal spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled queued for hours to get some information from someone they rebooked me on a flight for hours later without checking this was ok only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass this means i ve missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses a lot of money coming out of my account whilst i wait for this now i m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me i have to wait at baggage reclaim and see if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings back with me these are merely the most significant issues there were more and i m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided between this massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business 
729, british airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game 
730, london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael croft s review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the low cost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top 
731, palma to london heathrow how does british airways get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff management these issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in let alone try to make himself look all eco friendly with such comments i have been a loyal customer for over years and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now my patience has run out 
732, london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation presumably because the striking staff didn t turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was basic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet
733, london to faro we booked our tickets family of two months before the flight with british airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seats has been booked and paid quite high amount for seats for the row and outbound flight row and two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british airways we ve found out that our seats has been moved to unlucky inbound and to a outbound they ve split all family quite far away apart from each other as well customer service has hang up on us for the first time and second phone call has promised to call back but never did will i ever over pay difference so i can have good customer service with british airways ever again the answer is no i am extremely upset that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airways 
734, calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation 
735, london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to baggage drop it was quick and worked well our bag was kg maximum is kg so we had to take kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it wasn t a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in h m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a so there was no ife we had a hour delay from the bad airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and wasn t too expensive we didn t buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off hour late and we went home the verdict is that british airways are pretty good despite the delay 
736, nice to kuwait via london my flight from nice was delayed in the plane for hours and in delayed in heathrow for hours when we finally left the plane there were no information on how i get another connecting flight since due to the delay i had to miss it then i had to pass through immigration which lasted for hours there was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us now it was am with no one to speak too and i still don t have my bags i had to grab a taxi to sleep ba didn t not provide a hotel stay i i then had to leave the apartment at am to get to the next flight with kuwait airways 
737, buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew back from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess amelia who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen 
738, hong kong to london heathrow this is a long haul flight operated by boeing er the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat this negatively affects the legroom the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television they provide dinner and breakfast for me it is quite abundant but not very delicious 
739, what happened to a great airline got to heathrow hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only operators and then after minutes a rd appeared minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through there was operator on this line and it took another minutes waited over hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over minutes no bag got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been members of staff at bag claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least times to book but website does not process speak to ba at st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the bags stated on web as bags ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good 
740, london heathrow to malaga in business class full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight held in the airbridge for mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why on boarding cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers not a great start usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money the breakfast standards full english are about the same as a charter flight standard and despite what ba shout about this has gone through some considerable cost cutting ba can perform well on a good day but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front which was a shocker 
741, i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace 
742, seattle to durban via london on th of july i arrived late just before departure time hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents when i was rushing back to the security i met the lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in durban as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in durban on my arrival in durban i got all my bags including my back pack i would like to say thank you to the british airways staff especially the lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i didn t get their names i was panicky thank you so much 
743, london heathrow to austin hour flight in a boeing noisy cabin tiny screens collapsing headrest chocolate on my seat selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi poor food with choices running out 
744, mykonos to london flight delayed and waiting to depart they are not on time be prepared to miss your connections take off hours late the staff is some of the worst i have had on airlines you may be stuck on the runway and they won t offer you any water the worst business class experience i have had 
745, johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape town s domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with made to order drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a x configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a down to earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane board but since it took only minutes to board a rather full it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa s busiest air route for the price paid i d be happy to fly them again 
746, grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room i am a slim ft and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was it is now we were sat in the outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become we sat in a which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity 
747, prague to london a two hour flight on th july was delayed by hours with no heads up given by ba there was no sympathy or compensation especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel 
748, london to dubai lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats then it would be perfect that s my only note 
749, tel aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on flights i haven t travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
750, i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class from start to finish it was a shambles i was sent to the wrong baggage drop then to the wrong lounge i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this 
751, the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks 
752, stockholm to london worst business class flight i have flown split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked the meal was inedible for me and was the worst airline meal i have been served 
753, seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight no drink no snack no bottle of water was offered no amenity kits when i asked they said none were left in stock they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush which was ok and fast track invitation which was useless since no fast track is offered to british passports i was not given a menu i even had to ask for it i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping ok fine but even when i was awake no one bothered to ask me about the meal i had to ask for the menu a bottle of water and the meal and after all no apologies from the staff too many people are squeezed into business class even though i could lie down degrees i had very little space at my seat given the very expensive fare i expected a much better service for business class passengers i m very disappointed and will never use it again i won t recommend british airways business class to anyone 
754, premium economy don t waste your money on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food i use this term lightly wasn t fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didn t taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok not really a saving grace one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don t bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didn t bother trying it the look on other people s faces was good enough for me to know don t bother which in comparison to the outbound flight london to orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldn t log on so saved some money there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldn t happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you don t have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line that s the one that s empty cause they tell no one about it 
755, lisbon to london business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat no leg room for me meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class all that was left was cod freezing cold but no blankets poor staff spent most of the flight apologising never fly british airways 
756, heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to days to think about it 
757, madrid to london with british airways there is nothing left of business class on these flights when they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window see picture and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage just a backpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn t fit anymore in coach to business class ridiculous service so not worth the x cost that a business class ticket goes for feel totally ripped off 
758, gatwick to glasgow awful experience our flight arrived over hours late at pm so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute british airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn t their fault 
759, frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partner s bag for around mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time 
760, london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed getting to sardinia and so we waited but following check in at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and we re now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be they need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
761, rotterdam to london city after waiting for hours at rotterdam airport delays i was told they re routed my flight to amsterdam and that i needed to quickly catch a taxi that i have to pay for from rotterdam to amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there as i worried i wouldn t make it i asked to be put in a hotel fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked there was no apology no offer of a bus or taxis to those re routed to amsterdam and throughout the process long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening had i known we d be re routed to amsterdam i would ve left rotterdam earlier rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end what a waste of time energy money and no apology to make up for the hours or delay it s quite unbelievable 
762, return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented 
763, barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta it s all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for hours they reappeared about minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served our flight out days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on 
764, i would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba from london heathrow to singapore on june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british airways 
765, madrid to london heathrow this was my second trip madrid to london on british airways since may on this trip like the previous the plane broke down and we waited hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was degrees the cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar only ba could try to make money out of one of its technical failures i then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase as i m a silver card holder i could access their business lounge in madrid i regret using it fortunately this was my last ever trip on ba 
766, ba heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon 
767, hamburg to abu dhabi via london heathrow initial flight from heathrow to abu dhabi was cancelled had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well service with not a free glass of water on the first leg abu dhabi to london delayed by over hrs a generous dirham voucher received from ba which was enough for a bottle of water or a coffee 
768, new york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as gorgeous which came across to me as inappropriate i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very basic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the bathroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been done away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a non stop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxiety inducing 
769, london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we would definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came back with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special 
770, gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high cost route the pillow is fabulous gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming 
771, london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip 
772, ba and return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a on both legs sat in row outbound rows behind club europe sat in row on the return leg room seemed tighter than row the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didn t bother with the new m s on board service outward but did on the return the m s sandwich was everything you would expect from an m s sandwich apart from the cost but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the cabin crew the best part of minutes to get from row to row the other members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to also a queue of or passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they would not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr 
773, heathrow to kalamata heathrow t to kalamata greece th june and return week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news took off hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about hour on the journey out also left kalamata about hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jet com so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course m s offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fa s so all in all decent flights haven t used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right 
774, london to gothenburg unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess extra visa checks passport checks separate queues additional controls heathrow terminal is the most bizarre 
775, amsterdam to london on th april i arrived hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delay when i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person everyone had made it before me my bags were already offloaded she continued to say after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me 
776, istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a neo the aircraft is set up with the first rows of regular seats and the remaining rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however hours minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after hours the members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products 
777, i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for people by and seats were only booked on the lhr kul and return kul lhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing has no way of changing the airflow to your seat 
778, london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment 
779, london to seoul nightmare experience with british airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a hours long hauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take 
780, london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame flew back premium class more room i probably won t use them in november when i go back timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didn t get a headache 
781, newcastle to delhi via london at check in i was charged for carrying kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of for kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then asked for a bottle of water which she seemed to forget hours into the journey my in flight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking 
782, miami to delhi via london the ba business class i flew for the first time recently was the worst i have flown whereas most have four seats across british airways has eight the lay down beds are hard thin and short not worth the money 
783, london to sydney via singapore checked in with a bag which was kg my allowance was kg i was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage really i found the food on both legs of the flight horrible 
784, phoenix to amsterdam via london it was hrs on a delayed flight in a cramped seat with no lights no call light no entertainment of any sort and food i found exceptionally bad the b that was terribly maintained the offer of gbp for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety 
785, standard run of the mill airline for today s economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to ba com and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere points my balance is around 
786, belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t check in was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i wasn t an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and bare bones as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as we re used to getting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded user unfriendly t although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as delta s the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible we were given half sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t 
787, buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my back while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful 
788, london to nashville the worst airline trans atlantic despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville british airways ruined this trip the flight was delayed by over three hours whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing from san jose the airplane was filthy dirty in club class which is bad enough having to suffer the awful dated club class ying yang facing narrow seats with divider business class on british airways is the worst of any airline the wifi was out of service on late arrival in nashville my luggage arrived soaking wet and i was unable to change clothes on my return to the uk i contacted british airways customer relations to seek compensation and got the usual pathetic mainly computer generated insincere apology i am now forced to haggle with british airways and endure their woeful so called customer relations department it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier british airways treat their premium class customers with contempt this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow 
789, flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness 
790, just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba the check in process was disgusting minutes queuing ba staff working in two desks one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers she seemed to take an eternity in the minutes it took us the queue never dropped below about people i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk the adjacent jet desks had seven staffed desks and i counted staff the welcome sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of you re in for a long wait to cap it all after enduring the queue we re now delayed minutes thus far so unprofessional 
791, gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase it didn t arrive i was asked to fill in a lost luggage form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said she d make sure the suitcase was delivered by p m i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadn t been delivered the next morning sunday i phoned the number again the answer message said phone back on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at pm my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there 
792, my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is each and there s a fee for them to do it over the phone that s and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event the flight was delayed and arrived hr mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didn t work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it s normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can t give us a refund because we got on the flight 
793, i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn t fit the bag in the space remaining so they kept the bag on my laptop bag when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down i was travelling with only one laptop bag placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this 
794, london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this one was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isn t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved 
795, london heathrow to dubai last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought 
796, london to seattle my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb i d like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed 
797, johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat together when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you get advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because one of us was ill 
798, london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i didn t use flight departed minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights 
799, the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pre take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba ying yang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of starters mains and sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite run down escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only one other arrival but we still waited over minutes for luggage to come through 
800, london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy more on that in the seat review again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls 
801, cpt is definitely getting its act together ba s galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world that s despite the ancient yin yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw soft design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the triple bread roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience 
802, sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a bad delay on the belfast flight we were not allowed to re enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had gone through security only after minutes were we allowed to re enter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted hours minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the hour flight from sofia i will never set foot on this airline again 
803, lima to gatwick helpful and courteous cabin crew the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory the screen was small and in poor condition movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally without warning increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset a hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system 
804, inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways service was very good but comfort was very bad for a hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights 
805, i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steak veg fruits was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cereal yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight 
806, flight was ok minor delay didn t both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight 
807, gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife s remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wife s wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor 
808, marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me 
809, the cabin crew on flight ba london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i would write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks 
810, gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if you re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn t a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldn t expect this and i m sure it s just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus 
811, boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a for the first time paid a steep for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard one comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however was a disaster none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher 
812, london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new soft product still unfortunately a year old that hadn t had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door that s falling off its hinges a non touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won t stay shut don t pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on board service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same low res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its long in the tooth first class when their new club suites are launched 
813, this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba from jfk new york to heathrow on tue th may i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedule however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hour s delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldn t do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on 
814, london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate bags i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance 
815, gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens one hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers don t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets 
816, i paid an extra for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i would be happy to pay for their premium seats i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of 
817, faro to heathrow flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster we fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it same happened on flight out too it is a shambles and a disgrace waited mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again avoid at all costs 
818, vancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best 
819, gatwick to tenerife all so wrong lounge really overcrowded food on the plane pretty horrid left most of it paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner this is normal procedure apparently on top of a six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner total madness this is an airline with a self destruct button such a shame have just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires did not even bother to look at ba 
820, washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on first class i wasn t overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldn t have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training 
821, rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed back early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight 
822, london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before i d even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after i ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that i ve given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though sorry ba not good enough 
823, their customer service is horrible lost our bags here we sit in london after days of wearing the same clothing we fly out in hours to barcelona for a day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go i spent so much on this trip to celebrate my husbands th birthday and our th wedding anniversary it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime we have really been trying to make light of things but not getting our bags today as it s now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle is heartbreaking not one single person at british airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy for that matter one customer service agent even asked me if we would be ok getting out to heathrow to pick them up truly the worst customer experience i ve had 
824, london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew 
825, i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport they informed us that the flight will be delayed for hours from am to pm then another hour and a half until pm we lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not inform us about it i understand that unforeseen situation can happen but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life 
826, london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba april his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight 
827, vancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them 
828, miami to london heathrow with british airways top deck of with one experienced and one new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected on time arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers 
829, houston to london the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem i ve no problem with that i like travelling safely i thought well i m sure i d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water explaining the problem he fetched me a sandwich and various bits he d scrabbled together from the kitchen later when the liquid refreshment cane round both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it 
830, london to delhi the worst business class trip for us seats much smaller than business class on singapore air thai international eva air qantas not seated together same surname mr and mrs but moved after no privacy on middle seats one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes ipad makeup and sponge bag book etc film tv selection was very limited and my choice wasn t working the food was very poor main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic no tea coffee or chocolates offered to us breakfast had no jam with the croissant nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages the crew didn t put themselves out if one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn t get it i would never choose to travel ba again 
831, bucharest to london my flight with british airways was hours delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i was informed that under eu regulations i would receive euros compensation to be informed days later that this was an error and that i was no longer getting compensated british airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight however there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy i believe that if not on legal basis british airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a hour delay within europe is significant many times i picked to fly with british airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that it s not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airways 
832, london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle i was on a seat next to the aisle we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter 
833, madrid to london we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats the original booking was from iberia part of iag which operates ba iberia and air lingus ba clearly do not integrate into iberia s systems since after paying for and closing our seats upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba these flights were operated by iberia and ba ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow ba explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund total joke since we paid for the seats additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice we ll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag ba has let the customer down again just simply poor ba and low bar as always expected more for full fare business class rated since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats 
834, dublin to london heathrow british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the check in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed on time and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable 
835, london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe ba is the only one flying s to europe from seattle overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do get it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck i hope ba will improve their act i certainly won t use their services in foreseeable future 
836, london to gibraltar check in at t was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar a good flight
837, london to boston ba replaced a with a very old boeing video system did not work for more than hour then work for a few hours and stopped working no wifi very old plane service ok not good for business traveling 
838, london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage 
839, london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well done ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful 
840, larnaca to london this a is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid for my flight it s disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat it s a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing 
841, i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added times during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reasons the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i would have had to pay about thirty pounds the check in area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the check in agent was very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly 
842, the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare check in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty some of the to buy m s food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew 
843, london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable 
844, bridgetown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests he d been forgotten i requested express service which didn t happen website advertises premium levels of service and every journey unique and unforgettable the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons don t waste your money with this airline you don t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you don t pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really 
845, st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article of ec stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat ba s latest advert celebrates years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called salvation and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article of ec regulation is worth reading if this happens to you 
846, chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldn t check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldn t allow me to do this 
847, london to bangalore this was the worst experience i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter i found the food portions so meagre not sufficient for a child also british airways is sad in every sense of the term 
848, hamburg to abu dhabi via heathrow the h flight from hamburg to heathrow was like flying a budget carrier no free service at all everything has to be purchased at inflated prices heathrow t the usual chaos i can use the f lounge due to my one world status massive lounge crowded with the charm and food quality of a cafeteria toilets filthy one of the worst lounges i ve seen boarding orderly and well organized boeing ife screen broken seats very uncomfortable and narrow service and food quality average flight abu dhabi to heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew this is something i have never experieinced before rest of the journey uneventful overall a rather disappointing experience ba cannot compete with the middle eastern carriers 
849, london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i don t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning however it s great to see ba treat their customers with care 
850, doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october nothing has changed the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of bags kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class 
851, madrid to london ba on the couldn t have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well done to the crew on that flight 
852, on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon thanks the return felt like a hour easyjet flight one meal and one half meal limited drinks very small seats i m foot and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre 
853, london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british airways tradition friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older ife selection good 
854, the first class zone at heathrow t and the concorde lounge are very good service on board was excellent in both directions the cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about the screen is small with poor resolution i enjoyed the flights in both directions mainly because of the service this first does not compare well with that of middle eastern and asian airlines but ba business class is so poor i either fly economy or when i am very lucky try to fly first 
855, i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago i had requested a special meal but that was not available when i complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering k miles the bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest video screen is small and must be stowed away min before landing cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button in flight entertainment is poor 
856, leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over when i indicated one checked bag i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and one bag included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was non responsive 
857, dallas to london heathrow in first class this is the worst experience i have had on a flight the crew was indifferent and unresponsive and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers this was nothing but a waste of money i doubt very much i will go back to british airways again 
858, tenerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around degrees leg room is also non existent m s food ran out halfway through the hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals can t fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous it s clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory 
859, heathrow to larnaca departed on time flight nearly full m s food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle larnaca to heathrow two messages received while in larnaca airport the flight would be delayed by over an hour departure was supposed to be at pm but we took off nearer to pm the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us the flight was hours long so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable worse than a budget airline a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a balance problem in addition i was incorrectly charged eur on the return leg for my case it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers the only saving grace was the cabin crew particularly the customer service manager who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout how british airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me 
860, los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the x x layout is one too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways if you have an aisle seat in the turn right section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally by economy section passengers with their carry ons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone thanks also to two people most of us forget the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well done ba for providing such a good product and service 
861, london to phoenix ba yesterday the plane was supposed to land at however it landed at because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario california aboard american airlines by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage it was already the flight departs at i went to the ground crew of american airlines they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway they then directed me to british airways i went to the ground attendant of british airways and she told me to go back to american airlines to get it re booked i went back to american airlines then they told me again to back to british airways since they are they the one who caused the delay i went back to british airways with the american airlines supervisor the british airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning she did not offer any explanations or anything american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation i ended up getting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines 
862, san francisco to london after paying for flights which i had to cancel they wouldn t allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldn t give me the avios points because i wont be on the flight 
863, rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use check in procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they don t serve anything free on all european routes 
864, cologne to gatwick in economy class with an silver status ba card no online check in available ba website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport hours before flight departure but airport check in the only available option starts hours before departure no lounge available there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers except ba no priority boarding for business and elite level passengers boarding the plane by bus not even free water on board in economy 
865, tampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldn t let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can t do anything and i can t get on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won t reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received 
866, london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler i ve been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available i m very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways keep it up guys 
867, gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a th birthday celebration tickets bought in august and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that we d been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way back to london exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service days later ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats ba has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you get charge to pre reserve in club and in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you don t deserve to stay in business 
868, it s been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that s all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants couldn t do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it on the way back i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and get it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though i m ft ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder 
869, london heathrow pisa return my wife and i fly this route times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad wine on the way back a ploughman s lunch it was okay ish as a year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the us japan and the middle east and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest plcs in the country i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year oh what a surprise and that s the clear objective of the directors so what would i do with club europe i d make it the best in europe the seat would be larger like an arm chair a configuration there would be a nice centre table charge ports for phones laptops headsets tv screens mainly for news but some movies for flights over hours extra of leg room behind row nice cutlery and glass china ware hot meals and i d probably sell it at a flight more build value guys and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way back on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good 
870, edinburgh to boston via london the planes are ancient and need to be replaced if these were cars they would have an antique plate the seats are uncomfortable and worn there is no lumbar support the space between the seatback in front and your face is inches it s really claustrophobic the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice so for each we had horrible seats and terrible food the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water the m s menu is expensive and offers limited choices meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good there was one member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board british airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing 
871, gatwick to mauritius my wife and friends booked and paid each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter trading standards are also being informed it didn t help the aircraft was delayed by hours on the outward leg was filthy dirty the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues i am a licensed engineer a marketing email in celebration of years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return british airways you are a disgrace get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for 
872, flew out of heathrow on nd feb to new york mins into our flight and we noticed our tv s weren t working travellers but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight 
873, horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return i am only st and i find the leg room too cramp the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time it was probably in the last hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop the food was barely edible coming back on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off this was the worst flight i have flown on last long haul ba flight for me 
874, new york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow quick mediocre food service then gone chair is set up so i m staring at a stranger it s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didn t wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now i m on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just seats with the middle one blocked out person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest i didn t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for long flights i won t fly ba again 
875, chicago to london heathrow club class on british airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes circa year old b s but they perpetuate the dreadful ying yang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then mid flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger no mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible breakfast was inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at o hare was a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese insufficient chairs and a single old tv does no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers 
876, london to chicago could it get any worse the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing the british airways first class product doesn t come up to modern business class standards this particular flight was late again and the food wine was simply awful there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class and the crew demonstrate no sophistication this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain finally not only is the aircraft tired and worn out but the in flight so called entertainment system did not work and had to be rebooted twice the first class seat is a bad joke and extraordinarily uncomfortable british airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product all that can be said about this airline is woeful the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty and desperately needs refurbishment 
877, prague to london heathrow very disappointing service cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin on a two hour flight that was already delayed payment machine was broken staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley on the bright said i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices 
878, london city to florence my flight was at around am in the morning not only it got canceled hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldn t select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with more of course why couldn t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page 
879, london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i would love a g t to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure pm is not late for me and that no pre dinner drinks would be served i insisted this is business class after all half full flight minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it g t first dish main dish and dessert never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until hours before landing other passengers in business where treated the same and complained 
880, doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and bad still with ba bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival leathery and inedible why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand 
881, miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees 
882, london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it hadn t been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work 
883, london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge galleries north was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight 
884, san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at the crew had one interest and one only to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i wasn t offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they weren t interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline 
885, gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system always hit or miss before and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today s experience i will consider them in the future much improved well done 
886, london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly 
887, london to tampa ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss i just got a new one the new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad so on top of the new suitcase i had to actually pay ba to check the new bag cost me over for their mistake they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad you will get an email a month later saying i d like to know you that we are unable to offer refund make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service 
888, my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the th february every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer the plane was shabby and dated the seat reclining facility did not operate properly was not that comfortable and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly one ear bud on the headphones did not work the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in flight entertainment which in itself had a dated choice the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew they were abrupt unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there there was one exception an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co ordination when distributing the meals our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re assure them british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option 
889, bridgetown to gatwick i couldn t imagine that first class on ba would be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar emirates etihad singapore thai etc for double the price cabin seats and food equals business class one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service but first class on ba is not worth the fare when i complained to customer service after i got home all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller 
890, london to athens classic ba love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster problems in december at heathrow check in when ba check in and baggage management it systems went down for at least minutes total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving minutes prior to their departure and given priority even though we were checked in at some point the flight was delayed by hours on top of the problems then flight does not have enough food onboard at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum 
891, i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth check in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused us already about mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after or hours the flight was full of overseas travellers we spent hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane times in total and no food or water was offered to us we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london 
892, flying premium economy on british airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again 
893, tokyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing we had a good check in experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing were good a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifully presented japanese starter followed by a bento style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger s footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight 
894, london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check in area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it didn t feel like a long haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep 
895, i was flying london to billund today via british airways and i was a bit hesitant as i ve never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a kg bag to also check in and check in closed mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could get to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british airways like no other and i m very grateful 
896, san diego to frankfurt via london it all started when trying to check in online h before departure from san diego to heathrow on long flights like this i always reserve an aisle seat online check in did not work no reason was given ok let s call us hotline i tried at least times answers were either that call could not be completed check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now i did not make it through as an act of desperation i today called a british number the lady told me guess what no more aisle seats available some other numbers i tried were available on weekdays only good to know if you need help on a sunday so i ve got the strong feeling that they do not even care about there customers b on my flight to san diego days ago my tv screen was gone and there was no way to change seats great overall experience 
897, flown with british airways on numerous occasions with no issues however on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at gatwick there was no british airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to singapore which i received the following day 
898, flying last sunday from geneva to piladelphia via london in business class when i arrived at the boarding gate in london to take my flight to philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available they overbooked my choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight they just did not care about their customer no phone call no email no indication at the lounge nothing until i was at the boarding gate i kindly accepted to take the next flight the plane was delayed by hour due to technical issues when i arrived at philadelphia no suitcase no british airways desk on arrival it was late no one could help i finally retrieve my suitcase days later broken during these days it was impossible to get someone on the phone on my flight back to geneva same issue no sufficient business class seats available it is clear that this company just don t care about their customers they just care about their money 
899, london heathrow to paris cdg quick and easy flight to paris took just minutes to reach cdg everything went well and the cabin was very clean the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized 
900, johannesburg to london at johannesburg used ba galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy plane boarded on time very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit given aircraft at jnb all day perhaps this could have been addressed after take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal portions of starter very small i was given someone else s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him i thought that originally the idea of the new club world meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that main was good beef dessert was cheese very small basic selection then bed gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable breakfast was ok delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue there seemed to be a few of these arrivals lounge was good overall an average experience 
901, edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing baggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was get it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight hours gap mind you 
902, berlin to johannesburg via london the short haul flight between berlin and london was okay they don t include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low cost carriers high because of an engine problem the flights from lhr to jnb was delayed by h british airways gave vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks inside the a the ife boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space 
903, new york jfk to london heathrow with british airways an extremely average flight nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad the flight was smooth and felt quite short the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable the inflight entertainment needed some work 
904, i ve always favoured british airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check in and on flight catering for economy however ba have stripped both the above perks i now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet yet you pay almost double then today i flew back from denmark with sas and it was amazing and made ba look cheap not only do you get a good meal on board you get free drink can charge your electronics and get wifi for only euros outstanding 
905, new york to london via geneva with british airways the plane was late not an issue but some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly on a hour flight they served us the food mins after departure then mins at the most after started clearing we were not even close to finish eating then mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to this was really poor service especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us thats what you call bad customer service ps i was charged for a luggage after buying my ticket 
906, a boarding is always a nightmare but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show up by the pilots fortunately we still managed to take off more or less on time the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors premium cabin the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience but no comment was made the ife was passable and the sound quality good if one s own noise cancelling headphones are used wifi was available but i didn t make use of it breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered deplaning was delayed by half an hour because of early morning congestion at t and the lack of a stand overall a reasonable flight but not first class 
907, the seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than but it s showing its age in contrast to other carriers a full cabin also means queues for the two loos although they re a lot more spacious than in first the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement the fish option for the main course was some of the best food i ve had in the air the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight breakfast was improved with the option to pre select items arrival was ahead of schedule 
908, london to johannesburg smooth check in via club world desks fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly lounge was ok food a little better and staff seemed more attentive we were able to use the spa which was nice showers were fine with no queues flight left on time my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for hours lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older s which as my son says have a gap between stool and seat sometimes crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed the csd seemed to go through the motions only arrival fine and baggage was first on belt a good flight
909, ba on jan excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent the club europe catering was excellent i had pre ordered a gluten free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten free bread the main course was beef ratatouille with a do co dessert pot this was the best inflight meal i ve had on a short haul flight on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer minutes for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal 
910, whatever happened to the world s favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a worn out boeing my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it didn t work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me i ll put it in the book no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wife s entertainment screen didn t work the passenger next to me screen didn t work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the s out of gatwick are being updated can t come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we didn t get a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so i m glad i didn t my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too 
911, kuala lumpur to miami via london in business class with british airways the business class seats were small for business class and pretty old the flight entertainment system are outdated i am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class overall ba have to do better to be on top of their game planes has to be changed 
912, zurich to heathrow last year they started boarding flights by groups a week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating i decided no ba anymore i moved away from ba the only issue i have that now i have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines the last flight i took ba to use my avios points and i literally flew free but never to use ba again 
913, miami to london the breakfast served just before landing was terrible a terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit bar it was wrapped in cellophane hardly anyone ate it what a waste 
914, copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british airways there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and i enjoyed the flight the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh during the second flight from lhr to ams the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand like how the taxi from polderban is almost as long as the flight itself 
915, antigua to gatwick apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus we checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only seats for the of us remained unbooked we had to take seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats and on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets only loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us cabin pressure was uncomfortably low overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds tatty seat covers broken foot rest malfunctioning entertainment broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees when asked for help the stewardess told us she didn t have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue 
916, i understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible i paid to fly r t lax buh and yet they want an extra to have a desirable seat i understand if you check in hours before departure you receive a seat from those available but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there in my case they assigned me a middle seat on a when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign it is baffling the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make everything comes down to make every penny they can and why am i flying boac they owed me from the last flight b c the inflight entertainment system was inop for the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve hour flight on top of that their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that for normal sized adults it is as agonising as the rack must ve been and of course you only get compensation by patronising them again now i know ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced 
917, london to miami worst long haul business class that annoying divider the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats the service is non existent unless they are serving you the meal if you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member they don t ask you if you need anything between meals the toilets are dirty and basic i m a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines they ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it s not like they re cheap 
918, i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne the staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew a hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables chocolate mousse and biscuits cheese quality red and white wine was served the inflight movie selection was ok a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee tea getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports not my best flight 
919, boarding was fairly quick the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored i was lucky that no one was sitting next me so i had some more room the pre take off drink was water or orange juice within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef salad was served with a good dessert wine selection was very american with jug wines the movie selection was ok the pe seats are more comfortable than economy the extra inches of width make a huge difference the nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies 
920, bangalore to london ground experience not great at lhr automated bag drop didn t work and it wasn t clear why slow to react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated at blr no online check in available and slow process plane decor extremely run down and shabby various pieces of the interior trim bulkheads etc rattling and latches for bassinet shelves not locking row so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided seat itself could have more width i kept bumping the vod control and i m quite slim recline limited and footrest could extend more no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age vod itself is atrocious tiny screen folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats low resolution visible gridlines and very little choice hardly the latest movies to top it off on outbound leg the vod stopped working altogether and resisted many resets customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that food volume ok quality poor scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy 
921, barcelona to new york via london i was in barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing passengers to miss their connections when i finally got a flight we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly it took me nearly hours to travel from barcelona to jfk when i arrived my luggage wasn t there so i filed a claim i called and emailed every day and they couldn t find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation eight days later they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days as a result they have offered me no compensation for damages 
922, gatwick to fort lauderdale charging to choose seats even within h prior take off is outrageous so if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges 
923, we recently flew from london to bologna the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space so we did when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys so i approached the damaged lost baggage area lodged a claim and provided all the evidence explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap i was advised by the representatives to ring ba service line made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim well it is still going despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded they instead asked me to produce receipts from years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund 
924, venice to london city really we had a great experience with british airways we enjoyed very much flying with british airways lovely staff and great service 
925, san francisco to london terrible service and food cramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment in one of my flights it wasn t working the crew couldn t care less i will not fly with them again 
926, heathrow to vancouver the seats booked not given took months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an update a dirty plane fantastic front line staff i would never fly ba again 
927, london to bucharest first class ground staff but in the air it s quite a disappointment the basic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than in them and for a can of coca cola 
928, i forgot i had purchased a hand baggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at check in could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a bad low cost airline boarding process saw me in category having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the a economy cabin 
929, when the passenger in front reclines his her seat it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one s seat as the arm rests do not go all the way up the middle window seat passengers have to climb over there is little leg room and no leg rest the boeing ife screen is smaller than the ones on the british airway s s and could do with an upgrade the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew 
930, boston to london world traveler seats nice headrest legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his her seat the seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british airways magazine or even use my ipad we ordered special meals halal and low sodium the muslim meal chicken tikka masala with naan was restaurant quality flavorful and not spicy hot the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom s the low sodium meal herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries the ife was very good bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages 
931, london to athens we were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance they were spacious with plenty of legroom they had more width than the cramped boeing that we had just flown in on we each had a carry on however during the transit process british airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags i have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags bare bones service no meals which is okay no complimentary soft drinks or water bottled water was available for purchase in hindsight we would have been better off flying on aegean airlines 
932, london to johannesburg so impressed by the lady that checked us in something went wrong with my booking i was supposed to fly at with my boyfriend back home to south africa after our visit in uk but somehow my ticket was booked at we didn t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check in i was so shocked by the fact that i would be traveling all by myself it s my first trip overseas she was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of minute we obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other with grateful hearts we were checking in our bags when she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft how awesome is that thank you british airways and their helpful staff 
933, newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about more for premium economy about extra so approximately per leg was it worth it i d say broadly yes though i wouldn t want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of hours was involved before boarding premium economy does get a standard checked bag allowance whereas economy is bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow and india to us canada is one of those exceptions though it isn t clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the bag allowance boarding you board in zone after first business the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage if it doesn t fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly which can help if you re in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also cabin the has a nicely done premium economy cabin seating as opposed to in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy so not a long walk cabin has a seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to in economy the version used on the lhr blr sector has a very small premium economy cabin just rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the but premium economy was not full and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer seats food nothing much here i didn t think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage worth it on extra long haul like us to india bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs 
934, london to berlin scheduled for st december on approach to the airport i got a message saying that my flight was canceled no explanation was given as i arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company e g eurostar my costs would be reimbursed the airport staff also said no further help from british airways is available on the day to due airport issues i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day as it was christmas prices were very high after i arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with british airways started and british airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation 
935, london to mumbai i have had my battles with the leadership at ba because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly although i travelled economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food if i have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old is this ba s attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single use plastic e g water bottles duty free carrier bags into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine having been grumpy about several aspects of ba s service in the past i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements 
936, athens to los angeles via london worst flight experience i had a ticket from october travelling st december hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight hrs later athens to los angeles via london same day when arrive at london i realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated after i heard the announcement last call before departure i checked at the ba information desk and confirm my flight the one was cancelled i asked them and reply we found aircraft hrs before and rescheduled flight i send email and i had same response twice flight never operated or rescheduled i think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it 
937, our return journey from sydney to london which was approximately hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport was faced with one major issue we flew economy class with a two year old whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn t working having paid for our two year olds ticket you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed we were offered to move seats to the only seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was they said they would contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us by the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim i had already received an email from ba c s and that they would respond within hours which they did however all the could offered was a voucher to use on another ba flight i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning the flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it they charge per hour in economy class 
938, i had flown british airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey back home thailand on the th december i arrived at leeds bradford hours early so there wasn t a queue at the check in counter check in process took less than a minute as i already done online check in this means i just dropped my luggage the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft boarding process is a mess as there wasn t priority boarding i flew economy and no boarding groups luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door as the aircraft parked on a remote stand the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short luckily i was only m tall so this wasn t a problem the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition but the crew were very friendly and very helpful the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information as the flight departed the crew started on board service i didn t buy anything as the food option was poor expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards it was one hour flight so i didn t expect the top service standard the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic overall the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better 
939, gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring g medk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior 
940, booked a flight through expedia for june from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but wouldn t honor what they had sold me in the first place they would not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of plus paid for upgrades 
941, johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight pm the crew decided not to offer pre dinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep big mistake you only get the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when everyone else finishes so much for getting more sleep the crew never came back until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment 
942, london to kuala lumpur this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come back to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice i made a complaint to the crew that my seat b has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next hours crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it which didn t help either the tv screen on b was also not working and i didn t watch anything during the whole duration of the flight i would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a i am dreading on my next return flight back to london crews were friendly and helpful no fault with that 
943, los angeles to london heathrow very poor customer service i checked in hours prior to my flight departure asked can i have aisle seat and she just said no i asked her why and she replied that they don t have any in the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don t have space and you can put that underneath your seat they served dinner and said we don t have any more chicken so you can have pasta i told him i don t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food he said the pasta is vegetarian 
944, our flight from seattle to london in november th was canceled due to technical problems after waiting at the airport for hours and staying in the line for hours the ba associate couldn t find us any immediate flight they offered us a flight that would arrive in london late november th it would take us hours since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november i would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive my trip was supposed to be days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking i filed a claim online based on their instruction the customer relation phone number is disconnected in fact the automatic voice mail says please don t chase a call the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist after months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them 
945, gatwick to barbados we flew out of gatwick on the th december and back on the th dec it started well in the newish st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost mile walk which is a joke to be honest the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better i d guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the s t my first impression was how badly the new st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric it s probably under years of use but looks more like in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers that ba removed some years ago to save costs but re instated are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being an up market business class and this is true it is not a true st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer i have flown both in st the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking one meal it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff you d expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this st product for the next years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the cheap look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the superb laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline st class offer in krug a bottle more the alternative to st is of course the ghastly ying yang club business class the world s most hated business class in the sky i m a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okay ish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women 
946, moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the fleet are a real upgrade from the older product there s plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal i ve had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and i ll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin 
947, johannesburg to london for supper i asked for warm hot water to make milky drink as i don t drink tea or coffee for health reasons given with no problems for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused i explained i don t drink tea or coffee but milk and water we don t keep hot water i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger i kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining i have been waiting he said he will bring it in seconds and he never came back i felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing 
948, bridgetown to gatwick booked our return flight in business club class at each only to find ba want to charge an extra each to choose our seats awful seating with their ying yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin poor cabin staff attitude i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told we only do that in first class if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by food drinks being passed through the serving hatch otherwise known as a privacy screen to the inner seat this happened times a sort of sleep deprivation torture if you are expecting business class levels of service and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed 
949, glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife didn t work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly 
950, sydney to london via singapore i m hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired i e if you are on the isle you re interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you refer to seat guru for more understanding service is slow and once you have your food good luck getting rid of your tray for about minutes if you re next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do get a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont get me started with the in flight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies on a hour flight i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the new releases is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the plane s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats i would not recommend ba to anyone 
951, johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight 
952, antigua to gatwick one of the worst business class experience entertainment system didn t work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution service super slow crew to serve business class passengers food bad beef over cooked mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed woke up min before landing and offered a yogurt 
953, gatwick to barbados first class was third rate a disgusting cabin crumbs on the seat dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls it looked as though it hadn t been properly cleaned for days poor service and an entertainment system from a different age i have avoided flying with ba for the last years now i remember why avoid them if your route allows 
954, cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry on baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn t get the attention of steward to rectify i gave him one of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over cooked 
955, bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because the flights are too busy avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like we re being scammed 
956, kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on dec it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on dec i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip 
957, miami to london ba are going downhill having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey the choice was exactly the same this time i explained to the steward that i didn t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it basically he said i should have put my requests on my account but you can t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn t expect them only to have two menus the snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel bun totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff making a bad situation worse the light didn t work on my seat so i couldn t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv watching was incredibly hard entertainment having travelled four times in last month films have barely changed i won t be travelling with them again if at all possible 
958, i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa 
959, arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours during this time no clear information was available from the check in desk who were unable to confirm the delay or elsewhere at the airport over an hour after the flight should have taken off and after most people had purchased refreshments an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left meaning we then had to shell out for a taxi home despite this ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours hours minutes to be exact and took over a month to respond to my request about it this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba s transformation into an overpriced easyjet will not fly with them again 
960, we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy on october th i booked airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october st coming back november th as my grandfather was very sick and didn t have much longer to live on october th my grandfather passed away we put in a cancellation refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us of our seats even though we never used their services this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather in addition every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience i ve ever encountered i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future 
961, gatwick to las vegas boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about min after take off the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best i ve ever had on a long haul flight the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days all in all a very enjoyable flight 
962, nassau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana bread cake no hot food drink awful that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a lb male yes large but not obese ba premium economy forget it other airlines do this better 
963, phoenix to accra via london i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff 
964, manchester to london the bag drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already the staff offered little apology explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this staff on the flight were clumsy and rude one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology another flight attendant didn t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments not exactly best of british and i ll certainly not be recommending 
965, san diego to hannover via london i booked on ba com the longer flights both ways in premium economy on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day but had only coach available if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in days i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference a bizarre exchange followed first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat i told them to look at the ticket you can t get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund but you booked this with a travel agent so we are not in charge i booked with ba on their website they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund but then you can t get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight this is miserable customer service 
966, london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had one job to do put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support 
967, london to johannesburg turning right to the first wing at t was a new experience for us it was all pretty slick although the guy at check in wasn t exactly mr convivial the concorde room was impressive too particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design overlooking the main concourse boarding involved lining up according to group this smacked a bit of low cost airlines but i guess that s necessary with all the passengers on a double decker plane the first cabin on the a is definitely more spacious than on a and the suites also had more room and extra storage space the dividers seemed higher too giving better privacy the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus cabin crew were friendly attentive and thoroughly professional food was good too and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly the wines on offer were a good selection including the fabulous lpgs and we enjoyed some wine tasting sleep quality was considerably better than club world although the cabin temperature was a little high overall an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel 
968, having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing i was disappointed to have the flight re scheduled i rejected ba s offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to get a different ba aircraft when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost my husband and i were forced to sit separately at the booking in i was told that they could not find proof that i had paid for selected seats i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned on the return flight again sitting apart from my husband my tv did not work the staff could not have been nicer but could not find an alternative seat on return ba customer complaints offered a voucher on my next flight despite sending two detailed messages i received the same response completely inadequate service by ba not the flight attendants in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints 
969, vancouver to london heathrow i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my month old alone this was what i needed the booking process was not smooth and very stressful i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center the flights were great though the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot nope he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with minutes all the toilets in economy were out of order at least hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets i m sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant 
970, boston to nairobi via london the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow the cabin crew service was below standard i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eat drink while everyone around me was simply because i was watching a movie i noticed that if you didn t have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was worse because the plane was the opposite of the one from boston to heathrow it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port cabin crew service on this leg was below standard i m probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better 
971, basel to san fransisco via heathrow i m convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr twice as much as economy the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a and i has reserved an aisle seat the food was disgusting for me during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the uk the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing with the older bulkier seats you couldn t even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and i m not big the recliner didn t work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat i feel sorry for larger people the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks the staff seem challenged with certain situations next time i m off to the us i will look for an alternative airline 
972, london to lyon the flight has h delay for a flight duration of ground staff forced me to check in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with big cuts on the back then the customer service has been very useless such a very bad experience i do not recommend flying with them 
973, london to boston i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight superb customer service 
974, stockholm to london standard configuration on short haul european flights business class still seats each side of the isle middle seat fitted with a tray had a wonderful crew with super professional stewards in business drinks served with a smile and the food also food reminding of what was served in economy years ago when there still was free there the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding 
975, amsterdam to london arrived minutes late three delays taking off landing and getting the walkway to the airplane this has happened twice this year i fly klm of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely i fly british on this route when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed i m sure it s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day 
976, buenos aires to london we flew overnight friday th november the plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable there were large numbers or argentinian passengers on the plane yet i saw no staff that spoke spanish the chicken dinner was described as curry but there was no sauce on it the bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy during the night no water was offered to me it was not possible to charge electronic equipment the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment 
977, business class space is ridiculously narrow service is very careless you are not allowed laptops on the flight from riyadh so you cannot work if you want to you cannot choose when to eat 
978, aberdeen to heathrow to connect to a flight in gatwick the day after during check in using the ba app there was a problem that i had to re start after that when i opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold after calling ba and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay at the airport desk what a rip off for a short flight by curiosity i checked with easyjet and if i had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money ba asked for the bag 
979, i would not recommend this airline i travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to baggage allowance only give you kgs of checked baggage and if you are kg over regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under you have to pay aud extra this is the strictest airline i have ever used all other airlines have allowed up to kgs over at no charge ensure you have pre weighed all bags in flight meal on the way to sydney they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal it is an hour flight make sure you pack your own snacks meal you don t get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks make sure you pre pack a bottle or two once you are through customs customer service from the get go the customer service was appalling it is hard enough traveling with kids but having to deal with ba was stressful they wouldn t allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and i had a slight delay which meant i couldn t go on the same flight at the airport they couldn t find my children s booking which caused further delay and stress how do you misplace kids on the same booking they then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn t do anything to help change this we had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own don t bother flying ba 
980, new york to budapest via london the second flight was a bit different the plane was clean but cold i wanted to drink water but the cabin crew does not accepted my request by mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to bucharest and not budapest 
981, heathrow to athens on a arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease got to the gate within mins of bag drop with light security queues on the aircraft there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat f a funny safety video played and the flight was smooth no food was served except some m s bbc news was playing on the screens with no sound and russian captions quite confusing the plane landed half an hour late but it was the best landing i have ever experienced 
982, london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef a showcase of british beef the notes said that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or would i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine reds whites and champagnes hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations 
983, abu dhabi to london although a ba flight this sector was operated by air belgium and offered a really poor experience aircraft felt old and tired cabin crew were totally indifferent cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible a really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future 
984, gatwick to orlando stains on the seat cotton buds in the seat well disgusting and had to force them to clean no entertainment on board it was not functional internet available at three times emirates price and twice aa flight and speed that won t achieve streaming when i complained to ba they told me i couldn t communicate with the ceo but i could connect with their customer relations i have been gold on ba for thirty years and it s time to ditch this non responsive airline 
985, newcastle to las vegas via london both my flights were great on time and the food was good on the flight to london and a nice bottle of champagne as well my long haul flight was also good aircraft was yrs old but clean cabin crew were very nice friendly and efficient my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic the only complaint i can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved ie try showing some classic british comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of apart from that absolutely great well recommended 
986, while it is still fresh in my mind i d like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from st petersburg to london heathrow on rd october the check in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early the captain was informative my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the m s buy on board option was a bit tedious disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way this flight has restored my faith in ba well done to the superb crew 
987, london to philadelphia i upgraded from coach to business for almost because i wanted to experience ba s business class in the boeing but i was disappointed while the aircraft was new the staff really could have cared less about the business guests in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite service wise was lacking pre flight they offer you a beverage i asked for rose champagne and i was told i guess i have to go find a bottle and open one in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every hours not on this almost hour flight i was served my main meal almost hours after takeoff you get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing you also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is hours before landing if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley yes they have the menu linen silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that s it i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wi fi on this flight you get a pillow duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit ba has the new planes and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers 
988, madrid to london good improvement this ba club europe flight was on a b so seats were flat beds ba have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service three choices of main and food was good quality good ba listened to feedback they were as always let down by their iberia partners in that their madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual with no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables
989, london to munich the ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by minutes they hadn t finished loading the baggage and this was clear from the view out of the window where you could see bags still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for minutes before they retracted other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required 
990, london to cape town waiting at gate the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high air conditioning problem on board she said all doors of aircraft have been opened lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature boarding will start as soon as possible finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable 
991, full flight from muc to lhr with british airways on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly so is the baggage allowance plane although not new was clean you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights the departure was delayed by minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of minutes later than expected we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters 
992, manchester to philadelphia via london man lhr i am not tall so the club europe seating is fine for me on a short flight addressed by name adequate breakfast of bacon roll fruit and yoghurt concorde room not crowded and no wait for showers lhr phl on aged but still my favorite cabin washrooms in very good shape though i have no problem with the ba f layout unlike so many posters here excellent flight experienced crew and though full cabin all very smooth and professional beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank good wines as always nice to see a good british bubbly included only downside was deplaning in phl where f passengers had to fight their way off through the j scrum could have been controlled by crew but was not 
993, bangkok to london seating and interior old with a very small ife screen i did not like the meals had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner upon arrival in lhr others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me i was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but i found none the fast track security was non existant total experience was bad 
994, london to toronto day trip to play golf with my father and ba lost my clubs for days dealing with ba lost luggage customer service was brutal they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve them i had packed all my clothes with my clubs first days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials flight home from lhr yyz was an old with a misplaced seat cushion and a broken seat that wouldn t stay upright the ife system badly needs upgrading and no power ports at the seats grueling hr flight as bad as i thought air canada was they are light years ahead of ba 
995, london to vienna i was shocked that ba provides buy onboard short haul flights no free water coffee or tea i tried to buy something but my credit card wouldn t work and i could not pay with cash 
996, johannesburg to london i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class i have seen a change for the worst in ba service and it does not seem to get any better bedding finally a decent pillow a very good one indeed the rest is a waste of money unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly seated in a window seat makes it impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things i don t expect top food in a plane but i expect service if you announce things make sure you have them on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat premium economy however gets a sparkling wine you must eat when they order you to eat they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordon s you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner entertainment make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view ba offers you the most limited offer 
997, singapore to london heathrow it s my first time traveling on british airways the seat arrangement in its long haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward so you are face to face with the one sitting opposite you at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down there are club world seats per row for er which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route the cabin service was as good as expected however i saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night there could be some other choices 
998, london to los angeles booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional for our two seats the flight i chose was a boeing and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a to a twenty one year old jumbo we were then seated right at the back of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip he then disappeared never to be seen again food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off after a few hours i went to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch steak sandwich at least that one was edible the seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered getting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option as on club europe but with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile we only took this trip to use up some avios they have all been used now and we could come back from lax on virgin atlantic never again ba club world offered is a farce in today s business market 
999, miami to london heathrow as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with ba s customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline my issue was with faulty equipment onboard issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move back to economy asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and don t wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills i now have avios going to waste as my business will be going else where 
1000, london heathrow to milan malpensa worst airline i ve ever dealt with i fly times a year british airways lost my and my wife s luggage on our vacation they have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue they have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us please never book this airline 
1001, calgary to rome via london my wife and i booked our th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return with british airways sept this was my first trip in europe and we spent almost cad on first class tickets the flight calgary to london stopover was ok i got a bottle of water and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next hours one would have expected more from first class maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were mins late my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the mins and could not get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldn t get around ultimately we arrived at the rome airport mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldn t help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn t reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told basically that they didn t believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british airways like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support 
1002, london to bangkok flew british airways for the first time in a couple of years terminal is rubbish it may look great but you have to travel further using the train services to get there and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel again on another train to t a or b as they are again separate sections of terminal i usually fly eva and others from terminal and i would avoid t if possible from now on the aircraft interior was old and dated the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iphone without the technology the food was ok at best served cold to warm on both meals on both flights the crew were okay on the flight home however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag the flight had some drunks on the way back to the uk and while this isn t the airlines fault i did notice that when one young guy of about was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager he kicked off the next crew member did serve him this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british airways if there s no seats available anywhere else which is why i went with them this time then i guess i ll have no choice 
1003, london heathrow to miami the airport staff was very helpful the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well overall it was one of the best flights i had 
1004, london to singapore it was a wonderful flight i was lucky having a seats row for my own on the upperdeck but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect the crew was very friendly and the food was the best i ve had on an airplane if you fly the a in economy book seats in the upperdeck best seats on the plane a or k 
1005, dublin to london i was trying to add additional bag online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct but i was giving completely correct email address when i checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me as compare to online price afterwards i phoned customer care to discuss the issue customer care agent has dropped my call three times on fourth time i was talking one of the customer care agent he was not helpful at all then i asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager they put me on hold for about mins and said manager is busy this is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy british airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage british airways was always my first priority unfortunately i won t be flying again with british airways due to this awkward behavior 
1006, london pisa return i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany this in all reasonableness was the best so far but only just outbound we went through the first wing check in at t we are gold card members the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok the south lounge was rammed we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice the captain popped out for the loo and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation a very nice bloke who landed the plane superbly coming home we were delayed by minutes due to storm ali we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken downed a couple of g ts fas on both flights were great there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side the seating is still hopeless three seats between two and zero legroom ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points the every day fare price is ludicrous 
1007, i was in prague flying british airways back to heathrow apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed my flight was delayed until am the next morning there was no british airways person at the prague airport to relay this message some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the am flight the sheet of information didn t offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into prague this consolidator also mentioned that there was a flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight so after calling british airways and finding their offices were closed for the evening i went online and booked the flight because of the late timing i was charged usd then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone i finally learned that ba would only reimburse me the non used flight that i had booked months earlier at a cost of usd they also said they would send me a flight voucher not sure how many months it will take until i receive it is there any other airline that doesn t simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them i will never fly british airways again 
1008, ba kul lhr sept return ba lhr sin kul on sept all flights in world traveller plus with the exception of sin kul on mh economy on the kul lhr leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the py cabin the seats were the biggest let down whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support the headrest did not move at all the seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which i think is a missed opportunity by ba to maximise utilisation of space the food was okay you get two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke ife was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging the return flight was on an a excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight again seats were the same but the a has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin staff were less conspicuous this time around overall i would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats 
1009, we flew from los angeles to leeds bradford via heathrow on thursday th september with british airways and codeshare partner american airways we arrived safely but our bags did not it is now monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bags come on ba sort this shambles out 
1010, brindisi to london flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers there was also no priority check in or indeed priority anything boarding was a fiasco with two lines directed into pens pending the mad dash to the plane which then entailed using a rather weird tiered set of steps that was just another queue service in club europe commenced efficiently but the cabin crew were of the breezy cheery type who d have been better suited to ryanair the brief drinks service over it was on to the the much vaunted new look club europe meal service sadly this proved to be just another cost cutting exercise with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once and the appetiser and cheese courses reduced to microscopic portions in little pots and of course the seats haven t changed although interestingly ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section which means that the service is little different to the old economy still we arrived only minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes it s just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un business like 
1011, chicago to london i have flown long haul many times with both ba and virgin premium economy in my view whilst the virgin product has improved the ba equivalent has deteriorated such that virgin is significantly better despite booking and paying for seats with ba this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of wt on the a which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight for the first time in many years i found the food inedible and the service not great for example no cutlery initially on tray no food choice as had run out of other choice one drink serving and no where to get water on flight went through layers of customer service with ba on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg 
1012, berlin to london it was a connecting flight so i should not complain the flight was on time and the machine clean and they do not serve free water let alone tea or coffee while this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers ba simply turned into a low cost airline 
1013, british airways is my favorite airline boeing was years old but clean the staff was professional food was above expectation during hours flight staff is always there captain kept updating us about weather turbulence and time 
1014, rome to newark via london the first sector was on a a flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time boarding at fco was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups and flight attendants friendly and welcoming seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight there was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased even water no entertainment either was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the m s menu connection at t was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon boarding for the flight to newark was organised and painless i was dreading this flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped happy to say the seat comfort was pretty good legroom was manageable i was however surprised that for a year old aircraft i checked it was pretty dirty there was grime around the usb port which didn t work tv screen and along the floor by the wall the cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well i found the touchscreen ife to be outdated and slightly slow in response the selection was not as extensive but i did find some excellent british content that i had not seen before the real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly professional and warm they were with their service they were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick the main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing all in all a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector 
1015, london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal was rubbish tonight or so deep and it s really the only decent part of ba s ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route gets decent catering normally but only main options and the indian chicken was very bland 
1016, london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed ba s first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn t the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being over bearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didn t load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though 
1017, heraklion to gatwick left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake mins after i realised i went back to the airport but no british airways staff was willing to help asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar dialed for ba baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again this is so frustrating 
1018, flew madrid to london heathrow the is ancient and ba have clearly given up on hiding that fact i guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon i love flying in s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and ba should definitely improve this aside from this the flight was really very good indeed ba business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good ba cabin crew in business class are a real asset this was one of ba s more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere the flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks i ll be sad to see the s go but the time has come 
1019, london heathrow to brindisi we weren t expecting the long queue for club europe check in but mid afternoon is apparently particularly busy in t galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a was relatively new and clean no pre take off drinks were offered departure was delayed by about minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with pre school children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering it s hard to see the point of ba s short haul business class product when the experience is second rate 
1020, i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that it s sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a and seat c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on ba com they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal ba iberia are by comparison 
1021, hamburg to london initial flight from london cancelled from under us days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival total chaos ground service appalling and no free service on board checkin from hamburg appallingly slow and didn t open until hrs from departure check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it all in all an unsatisfactory airline 
1022, glasgow to miami via london glasgow to heathrow was painless as was transfer to t heathrow to miami on aging flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board kept informed by gate team about progress tv screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment plane was looking it s age and a bit run down around the edges premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on a what made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her service with a smile from start to finish people in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job also meals and drink selection very good although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done ba and looking forward to return journey 
1023, london heathrow to budapest after so much disappointing experience with ba this was finally a nice flight i got an emergency seat assigned at the online check in though these are usually for extra money on top of this no one sat next to me so i had better seat than the people in euro club business class since their legroom is the same as on economy class the flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway 
1024, budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full with kids and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on board purchases 
1025, london to toronto group of people age from to over business class seating in very conducive for family travelling allows for interaction forward business class cabin on is fairly private service on both flights was flawless very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic outstanding crew on ba and ba on our outgoing flights from toronto on august similar great service ba gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience their seating arrangement in club world is perfect when travelling with family other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone 
1026, madrid to heathrow i fly with ba on a regular basis and am a gold card holder their service attitude and facilities drop lower and lower the planes are filthy not cleaned properly between flights the staff are hit and miss but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out the food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable and as for customer service there is no point in ringing them they are useless rude hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever 
1027, singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp for being over the kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea 
1028, washington to frankfurt via london check in at dulles airport was smooth i asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did even though at the online check in there was none available boeing was years old the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad the seats were ok pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good my seat was a and i had the whole row for myself unfortunately a crew member shortly before take off told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they would replace him on c shortly after take off the service began there were food options available chicken and vegatarian lasagne i went for the lasagne which was ok nothing special it came with a salad a bread bun and a black forest cake all in all an ok meal nothing to complain about the crew distributed mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep i tried to watch some movies the selection was ok which was hard on this miniature ife in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle connecting in heathrow is pretty easy in t there are signs everywhere security went fast there is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free wifi we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds ba started to do a buy on board service which i hate however i thought the pricing was ok 
1029, rome to london our flight was delayed from rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to los angeles as we landed in heathrow minutes before the departure there were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow they put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff 
1030, i always like travelling on a ba a seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes however the food is really poor in the last months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british airways thankfully ba airline staff are always the best 
1031, london heathrow to d sseldorf really good crew on both legs of the journey got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too 
1032, london to athens since i started using ba in i can only say that the quality becomes worse the leg room in business class in a is the same like in economy the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat the meal choices are poor i had to choose between curry and fish pie also they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after mins once we ate the starter they took the starter plate and they gave us the main the on board service is less attentive than some years ago probably cabin crew are over utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable also due to the plane being late the cabin was not cleaned properly at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines tickets are priced in a similar way there is no food on board for the economy while for business the portion and variety are a joke leg space is small there are always delays to depart from heathrow not bas fault but at the end of the day i experience delays what is that makes ba in european flights distinct probably nothing 
1033, london heathrow to singapore had a great experience in the concorde room and galleries first lounges in heathrow t i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around all because i expressed a slight interest and for that i am thankful the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit the seat was very well presented there was a small amenity kit as well as a pair of pyjamas the seat was clean with pillows as well as ample storage space you get a closet to hang clothes a little compartment next to the seat as well as the overhead bin so i never ran out of room the pre departure beverage was a choice of water orange juice or champagne and hot towels were handed out the flight left slightly behind schedule but at heathrow this is something you expect very soon after take off the crew began serving dinner i had already booked my meal in advance but the choice of starters mains and deserts as well as the beverage menu was very good the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i would have it again once dinner service had finished the crew turned down the bed for me whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided the bed was very comfortable and at just over feet tall i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well when i awoke i was offered coffee and a short while later breakfast the breakfast choices were continental or cooked i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed as it was very tasty and there was a lot of it the inflight entertainment was good and there was a large range of films tv programmes series audio books and kids programmes to choose from the system was responsive and was good quality although i did not watch any films so i cannot speak of the sound quality the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte which the machine didn t do the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice they really made this already special experience even more special if you want to treat yourself to ba first i would thoroughly recommend it 
1034, philadelphia to london nice plane nice seats low quality service on the plane both my husband and i ordered low sodium meals his was delivered mine was not when asked the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray lsml obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm dry and i was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food not the same as my husbands meal so i have to take the airlines word lsml that it was low sodium attendants serving coffee missed us and when i pressed the call button it was over minutes before a flight attendant showed up one pass through the cabin for drinks after that you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous hummus limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least i expected edible food and better more friendly service with this airline our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew i thought british airways was better than this 
1035, london to las vegas i experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset the tray table did not stow properly so the armrest remained at a degree angle with the metal frame exposed the seat cushion was so badly sunken it was as if totally unpadded one air vent for the seat row and no in seat power luggage was mislaid for hours even with priority tag after writing to british airways regarding disappointing flight ba customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a usd voucher toward future ba travel to make up for their shoddy service if you have a choice choose another airline 
1036, zagreb to london and during the check in hours before i checked in via app i was offered no choice of seating during the flight i was asked by stewardess if i would like any food i find that approach not pleasant at all i was not personally invited to use the lounge i find that lacking for a business class fare 
1037, i booked a round trip from milan to california for my honeymoon first flight milan to san francisco via london while returning flight was from los angeles to milan always via london both flights faced hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination when you check in the bags business class is mixed with other one world members so it is not exclusive at all only first has some real advantages we found business lane crowded for the category worst business class experience and totally disappointed 
1038, toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt finally ba has moved back into it s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london apparently are loaded in london for the o w leg but none for the return friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables the salad is a nonsense a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibe s flower duet burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up the standard t cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is ba should be embarrassed that it s even offered after leaving toronto mins late we arrived early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne with a top up before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast bar service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak again alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with t c after a pleasant hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast bags too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba don t unintentionally promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the o w leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful both dinner and breakfast and it really wouldn t take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining it s mojo with great crew improved on board experience cuts reinstated and on time performance long may this improvement last 
1039, san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre reservation fees but still got seats together after the real scrum at the departure gate no apparent order struggle to get through to priority lane announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seats of course the usual ba club class scramble over the legs to get to the aisle and abreast not really a premium product in today s competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal beef with decent wines to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of blockbuster films very extensive choice for breakfast continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fa s made you feel welcome landed on time but baggage for some reason took about hour to get to the belt as usual i have mixed feelings about ba if we are lucky enough to fly club business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre reserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you don t have to pay to pre reserve your seat 
1040, london to dublin this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight ba managed everything in a very professional manner the bag drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb 
1041, london to paris i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any low cost carrier 
1042, delivering outstanding customer service onboard british airways may not have the cleanest newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight since i have flown with them 
1043, this was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not bad i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another pax in first but it s quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy it s irritating that they don t have any showers in the concorde room i wasn t amused to check in at the galleries business lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former it was pm early august in nyc of course i needed a shower departures from ny were running around hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point the cabin wasn t secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple and very welcome top ups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main wouldn t have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t arrivals toilets perhaps you saw me the cabin layout and bed well it s easy to find details of this elsewhere online but it s certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overly fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast i ve had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects 
1044, amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegans so pre booked vegan meals for our flight meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan was i e no dairy or eggs it turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals shortly after they came around with the drinks trolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i don t think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to re explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask when she returned she said we don t provide that sort of thing that was strange because weeks ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of getting rid of us so we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation basically the value of the meals that we could not eat in vouchers 
1045, paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed as were many other flights due to bad weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class we were offered a voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access was available the flight itself was ok although two hours late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at we were through passport control quickly and then waited minutes for the cases to be delivered again very poor show ba has some great assets particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a full service airline and in this case ba were lacking 
1046, gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the ba s club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew was good it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service was quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which was tasty and not dried out flight arrived minutes ahead of schedule very happy with the service 
1047, new york to nairobi via london flight attendants were wonderful friendly cheery and helpful but the business class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger even if you are seated next to a companion there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat even for a bottle of water the ife on the lhr nbo leg reminds me of the game pong in its resolution and food is mediocre at best ba charges to select business class seats for my family of it would have cost over to get assigned seats on the segments 
1048, istanbul to london heathrow the plane itself was old i found the food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back had to be checked in for security purposes this meant that when i was at ataturk airport we had no less than separate security checks before check in one after check in and one before getting on the plane because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the hours on the plane norwegian offers free wifi so i could check my phone on the plane british airways need to improve their service levels 
1049, bad service and attitude all round my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems ba refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs we were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy premium prices for a ryanair style service 
1050, london to santiago de chile i was flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row seats on the left side for my own the seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat i would have had enough space to feel very comfortable however lufthansa on the a also y gives a bit more personal space at least it seems to me the seat recline was good as well as the ife system big screen wide choice of programs of which i chose to listen to some bbc concerts the crew didn t impress me but was very friendly and helpful the food was extraordinarily good the chicken i had was very delicious with sufficient food cheese salad dessert the frittata on breakfast wasn t good however i didn t like that they sealed the drinks minutes before the arrival a bit early i had a good experience with ba and would definitely fly again as all the things seat ground service staff were like expected the dinner was way above average premium economy is a good value for money especially on a hrs flight 
1051, flew a now ageing b flight ba to seattle pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal ok choice of wine beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded comfortable seat but it s the old bug bear across with over the legs access to the aisle fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this can t come soon enough and abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system blurry old screens awful audio take your own noise reducing headphones and a pretty dreadful choice of movies fa s great welcoming and gave good service but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to pre reserve our seats up to per seat per journey not what i expect from a flag carrier airline we refuse to pay this extortionate sum our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld we can still reserve our seats for free with them 
1052, flew london gatwick to tirana rinas bag drop at gatwick was basically seamless and ba was offering to check in your hand baggage for free the flight was at and the gate was supposed to be shown at am which was oddly specific but as we got closer to that time that just got more and more delayed until we finally got our gate info at around for which boarding had already started boarding was pretty much seamless the cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice the legroom was alright perfectly fine for a and and a half hour flight good recline aswell i don t understand why british airways opted for buy on board their free food offering before was perfectly fine although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive and there was no real hot food options just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot flights were on time flights cost around return per person which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price so overall it s a good option but if you can find something cheaper then go for it 
1053, london heathrow to murcia and back a few problems at heathrow with the wrong gate being shown ba ground staff didn t seem to care this was an issue but the flights were excellent comfortable and on time i really don t mind paying for the food and drink inflight especially as you can pay using avios murcia airport also a joy small efficient and friendly i will only fly ba on short haul in europe very impressed 
1054, london to amsterdam ba s service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years but tonight s experience really takes the biscuit i should now be in amsterdam however i am still writing this from london despite spending over hours on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again after hours good news or so we thought we were to be on the move around minutes or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further minutes for ground staff to become available i must say during this and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave us the in flight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come ba s ground handling was attrocious we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings however ba had cancelled around flights and the queues were very lengthy vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the rooms were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home i was told to consult the ba app the following morning ba s app has rebooked my flights two days later when my trip was for three days total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess i ll be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep us on a plane for hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to hour airports i do not know and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad ba staff themselves were thin on the ground they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we don t work for ba excuse i ve had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldn t have handled it better by contrast i don t see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days save for the good lounges if you fly business 
1055, aberdeen to abu dhabi via london despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airways these days and now i ve reminded myself why flight crew don t afford old fashioned courtesy or service i m not saying they are rude just that they don t provide a decent level of customer service you get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact no bags at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling couldn t care less i feel hr delay on return flights seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender 
1056, prague to denver via london i almost missed my flight because at check in i had to complete some really important papers that took minutes later no one asked me for those papers flight to heathrow was average what you expect from a hour flight at heathrow the security lasted me minutes when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before the flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful but the plane had no paid wi fi no outlets or usb ports the screens were low quality 
1057, seville to gatwick if it wasn t for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i would never fly ba given the current product the cabin was old cramped and dirty the cabin crew were abrupt and surly the buy on board is still a massive bug bear we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary 
1058, london to amsterdam a delayed ba flight by mins old airplane unhelpful staff delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays another terrible show from british airways 
1059, gatwick to barcelona check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight however the in flight product has deteriorated salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers had to have sandwich seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class no priority boarding for business passengers really disorganized at boarding calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up on arrival no bags and trying to get update but no update trying to get update on baggage after hours but no update 
1060, i thought it time ba deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days i was fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently being able to check in at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus as is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong i found the on board service and operations a lot improved over the last time i flew long haul with ba the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates food and wine on board was quite good and overall service excellent including recognising my one world status ba has the best in flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in flight programs i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from goswami who found me a window seat for lhr hkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow all in all made for an enjoyable experience a rarity these days 
1061, faro to gatwick club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro ba now do have use of a rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful it feels like an average office canteen with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there it s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport it s a pathetic offering food was minimal and basic drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available whilst ba do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this once on board i have similar comments to my outbound flight in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier at one point i dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else s seat i was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that i was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it priority disembarkation and baggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly 
1062, gatwick to faro club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge the lounge itself is really nice spacious enough to have plenty of seating available and different types of seating but it also feels very cosy and welcoming the lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam as always the drinks offering in ba lounges was great the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system long may it continue on board was the usual club europe offering which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a hour flight is fine ba don t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind it s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier i would also like to see menus handed out before take off which could be done at the same time as a welcome the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price but a few small touches would make it feel much better 
1063, jeddah to chicago via london the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasn t as good as i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude also the new baggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carry on bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there they took my laptop when i dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers however the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous i won t fly with ba again until they change their baggage restrictions for the saudi flights 
1064, london to frankfurt i need to fly ba for business frequently as i don t have other choices not only planes are delayed as today but the lounges in heathrow are a joke i don t use them anymore as they are overcrowded and they don t serve proper food just snacks their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you 
1065, gatwick to malaga when booking the tickets i realised that by choosing certain flights in club the fare was cheaper than economy once i had added suitcases and pay for food onboard i hadn t flown ba club in europe for a while and was looking forward to it i was nicely impressed my outbound flight was a wet lease by titan but this was the full ba service the crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet i was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks the only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly 
1066, bermuda to gatwick usual window and aisle seat taken crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese including sandwiches not good when someone cannot eat cheese breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the money paid seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger s legs to get out from the window seat in the night 
1067, aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seats weren t wide enough and leg room was restricted on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests otherwise they were good flights with slightly odd choices but decent food extensive entertainment options variety as well 
1068, london to hamburg baggage self check in was diabolical machines were either slow or not working boarding commenced early resulting in on time departure seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor i don t expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been something crew were friendly and the flight on time 
1069, flew london heathrow to hong kong with british airways flew premium economy and the experience was anything but check yourself in create and scan your own baggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself unsurprisingly slow process and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line hardly a ba service attendant in sight better service with ryanair i hate to say it 
1070, flew to istanbul with british airways on th june at the passport visa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady my wife was holding the passports the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked passports as if she did not see my wife holding them second bark do you have a visa third bark show me fourth bark next no smile no hello or good morning hardly any eye contact either if anything the situation was worse at boarding ba recently introduced a boarding by group number system all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call when caught by the gate keeper they were told not yet some attempted to board prematurely more than once on the second attempt the staff told them to wait accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english 
1071, munich to london heathrow with british airways i booked my flight online about months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop the check in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too the flight was on an a and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus overall a very good experience with ba 
1072, wonderful service on the flight from edinburgh florence on july mainline british airways could learn lots from ba cityflyer and their franchise partner in s africa com air 
1073, london heathrow to manchester it was outrageous of british airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the i bought paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for hours and everything ran like a clock work different airlines until i encountered ba at heathrow check in and help desk are arrogant rude and are as miserable as hell not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a voucher and wait till minutes before departure to see if you have a seat we were passengers who had the same treatment from ba british airways is a disgrace of an airline because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service well they are wrong like others i have found an alternative airline i close my review and say i will never ever use british airways again i would rather walk to manchester 
1074, london to madrid lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i don t want any particular seat we are travelling as a pair there are three seats each side of the aisle there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this 
1075, luggage broken into no explanation first the good point cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba london to shanghai on june not so good the bizarre seating pattern that allows business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement the trust breaker upon arrival in shanghai i was not the only one from ba reporting missing luggage mine arrived days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use nothing was missing so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state ba have not provided any explanation despite queries to customer relations this is not acceptable corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff 
1076, london to tehran back in august the cabin looked so old and tired i struggle to understand why ba has not updated yet on a lot of their b aircraft the inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the s but the selection of movies was alright the meal service commenced and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i wasn t even sitting in the last rows of the economy section the seats were very uncomfortable a couple hours later there was another drinks service 
1077, pisa to london heathrow having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row of an a aircraft is standard seat pitch why didn t ba notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight once we d boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room the ba cabin crew did move my husband but said this happens all the time with row it might be an exit row but it s not extra leg room 
1078, i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to las vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded the plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded minutes late when we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around the service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated the return flight was a disaster the seats were dirty food was like rubber plane was dated seats smelt lauren perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great when i complained i was offered avios are you serious ba i think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british airways unless a first class ticket on british airways is on sale i would suggest you fly with another airline british airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty it s about time they had a deep clean and re model the first class it s getting so old it s like club class with a few tweaks 
1079, had four flights in total with this airline first flight from dublin to london on th june was delayed by hours this delay would have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by hrs no reason or apologies we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our bag despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day it was put on the wrong plane again no apologies given for this inconvenience we are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out seems like no one cares this was our first and last experience of using ba 
1080, johannesburg to heathrow british airways are not doing us proud i recently flew back from south africa with some sports equipment their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance but i was charged to bring my bike back the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt as i had to bring the bike back i had no choice but to pay when i got back i contacted their customer service they are not willing to help also the seats are getting really uncomfortable the food is terrible 
1081, the queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good mins a more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop excuses as i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine they could have just got more staff there to begin with group boarding was super slow inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and worn out the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn t inform the customers about it some of the flight attendants were unprofessional meals were bad for me the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good they gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a h mins flight the wifi doesn t exist in the cabin 
1082, british airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class no co ordination at airport and apparently not one ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to had to call ba customer service in uk which was a waste of time given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow advised stewardess but they did not care could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat waste of time paying to go business class with ba they did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way 
1083, mumbai to edinburgh via london i m quite surprised to read the varied reviews as i have always had a great experience with ba in terms of in flight service and airport handling after sales service can be a different experience this flight i arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues hot and sweaty and the check in girl was such a blessing she calmed me down reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly i was able to secure a very cheap last minute upgrade to premium economy and i am so glad i did the service was wonderful we were looked after very well lots of water offered throughout the flight i thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable even for the regular upgrade price rather than seats to the side and rather than in the centre gives you a lot more space the food was ok i ve had worse i ve had better but i was comfortable a good temperature and had a great choice of films my connecting plane was late leaving heathrow to edinburgh due to bad weather but it was handled very nicely all in all i m glad i flew ba for this trip 
1084, mumbai to london heathrow disappointing experience i wouldn t book business class again felt like bad value for money i ve flown economy and premium economy before found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really didn t see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost the staff weren t that attentive so i felt like i got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight i had one person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of money i paid an extra for better food on a tray with cutlery really not worth it 
1085, delhi to london having read many negative reviews about british airways i boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight it is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline british airways is no different to other european airlines as a resident of the netherlands i hear dutch people saying exactly the same about klm their national airline and french friends say the same about air france the onboard service was efficient and friendly if a little lacking in charm the food was more than adequate the in flight entertainment was adequate too i m not sure if the extra one pays for economy plus is really worth it in terms of better food but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters then it is worth it when we landed at heathrow a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic but the crew handled the situation admirably they more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking 
1086, when you travel british airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with british airways staff right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish hour and minutes before the flight she spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late because i need special assistance they didn t have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense my wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress the guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way the cabin layout has seats across whereas all the other s i have been on have that means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by of course the is a great aircraft so for me the seat was below my expectation i was also amazed that i had to pay to reserve seats i don t pay anything with other airlines the food was just ok nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who don t have snobs working for them 
1087, british airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to gibraltar was faultless on time early arrival in fact smiling friendly crew excellent hot meal and plentiful drinks gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge 
1088, ba first class is not even that any more starting with the lounge in t this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t but it need not feel like a rural train station poor food average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facilities in fra or muc there is no ground assistance and boarding was haphazard fine cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed the seat was ok but not in the same class as the new ac j class pods and not close to the emirate s suites small things like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seats in f seat comfort ok but nothing special and the toilets small and curiously offering single ply paper the crew were very friendly the service was decent in delivery but poor overall ba your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your first class product is not worth the name anymore one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product and no wi fi
1089, linate to london the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled with no specified reason as an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid then to palma to arrive the next day in birmingham disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england and waited minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator and i was offered a flight in the evening at which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined i had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to london in time unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune on top of it since the flight would arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted i had to pay the taxi more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow british airways did not take responsibility i was not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused the worst has been the answer of their customer care saying it was not their responsibility 
1090, flew british airways from jk to london heathrow then connected london galwick to rome bag has been lost for hours no email phone call text update they didn t even answer my email my wife and i have had the same clothes on our backs since we left jfk thank goodness for washing machines we have missed out on events we can t get into certain places due to dress codes we had to wait for a store to open to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste horrible horrible service then we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at pm yesterday it s almost pm the next day and the bag still isn t here 
1091, i have flown british airways numerous times over many years sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left too little had apparently been loaded there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice we asked for the fish after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice no apology eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice minutes before landing we were not given anything the service was really poor and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers 
1092, we can not fault the new club world food and service on the outbound and inbound it was great the food was first class the presentation very attractive the quality very high haven t had such tender beef on any airline before or in a restaurant for that matter lately and the new style crockery glass wear stylishly upmarket it s worlds away from what it used to be both crews were attentive friendly and cheerful really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to you now get a light day blanket a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get the pillow is larger and tons better than before can t believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in seattle and once home again we do mainly club europe flights shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new club world will be a great success 
1093, very disappointing experience flew out on a series should be scrapped departed late loaded aircraft ready for push back no a c temperature was excessively hot all flight no cool air personal media system broken split screen food quality diabolical moody flight attendants ran out of hand soap return flight on a left on time better service meal quality and crew definitely made up for outward flight been flying ba for over years probably would be a last choice in future sad to see 
1094, calgary to london cabin full overhead locker full of blankets seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently take off about local time evening meal appeared at about local time menu listed seasonal salad leaf one small piece of lettuce and cucumber braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta with butter pecan cake only beef meals available choice was either pasta or to go hungry i chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice breakfast a light refreshment including juice tea and coffee consisted of a cream cheese roll and oat biscuit and half a cup of warm tea some minutes later we paid extra for world traveller plus but i consider that we were conned customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing i received the following response thanks for coming back to us i completely understand why you re disappointed we couldn t offer you our full catering service especially as on such a long haul flight i hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering this meant they couldn t provide a full meal service and i absolutely agree this isn t what you would expect when you travel with us i m sorry we ve let you down that is it thank you ba this is the last time we will ever book long haul with you 
1095, london to zurich the airline isn t bad their boarding procedure was very good though the aircraft was very old i know it is one of the oldest and personally i enjoyed it but if i have to be realistic it s very old loud and uncomfortable the service isn t good either you don t even get a cup of water it s great to hop to london but don t expect any kind of special treatment or service 
1096, glasgow to new york jfk via london outgoing flight was on a refurbished still i could see its age we had a duo seat at the back of the plane the plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head the ife was decent and had a good selection the cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us flight left close to on time service was quick as we were first served at the back we were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later which was vegetarian pasta for me adequate amount of food served and was tasty ice cream and juice water was served halfway through the flight we then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone it was ok return flight from vegas was on a old horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff less drinks served again food was ok chicken curry this time small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast ife was horrendous on the old tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice i wouldnt fly ba again if i had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive also the planes they use are too old and tatty 
1097, flew on a last minute emergency trip london heathrow to baltimore with ba most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new boeing i found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes in its seating configuration despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft i have flown on other transatlantic routes a and ba needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid with no individual regulation this felt to me more like being crammed in to a boeing on a transatlantic flight 
1098, earlier this year my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to jo burg returning from cape town thru london in each direction having paid business class fares we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional for seat selection on the long haul sectors had we not selected seats we could have found ourselves not just separated but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the a on the way out and the on the return flight we therefore had no choice what sort of customer retention policy is this no other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection but ba just don t seem to care it is a rip off the forward rear facing business class seat plan on ba planes is really unattractive complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat ba should take a look at the emirates a if they want to see a customer friendly layout this was our first business class experience with ba having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are 
1099, los angeles to london i booked with aa lax to lhr round trip very far in advance ba is aa partner paid for the ba seat selection early to get good seats ba canceled the flights coming and going ba did not inform aa or me that the flights were canceled all of my text and phone number was entered with ba with my passport number they should have contacted me i found out a couple days before my flight because i happened to call to do a meal request it turns out that ba shifted to smaller planes and i actually spent six hours over two days trying to get flights on the days i needed to catch up with a tour all they said is we can t help you i kept calling and calling and got seats on the days i needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed premium economy was awful food was terrible we had pre paid to choose seats there were no good seats left we ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets which meant the smell people are bumping into you the lights going off and toilets flushing for hours same seats coming home i would have been better off flying in coach i have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection i tried to get this before my return flight started because i was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds they wouldn t refund after returning i made five phone calls and spent mins filling out a detailed request online called again today was disconnected twice and told there is nothing i could do it is possible i may get a response in a month regarding my email request don t ever fly with them they used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service if you have a problem you will be up a famous creek without a paddle they have an endless loop of calling waiting on line their agent s can t or won t do anything but sell seats i spoke to many many supervisors no results there is no one to solve problems they pass the buck have you fill out forms online and no one responds 
1100, the overall flight wasn t too bad seats and everything was comfy enough although my girlfriends television didn t work for either the outbound or inbound flight and little effort was made for a resolution i understand that it isn t the flight attendants fault but it would have been nice if a little more effort than there s nothing we can do was given to the issue on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately minutes as the bridge wasn t where it should be which once again wasn t the worst problem in the world but after a long flight isn t particularly what you wanted it wasn t the best experience 
1101, ba s galleries lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection including packaged cheese and biscuits with flimsy wooden knives and limited wine choices champagne was conspicuously lacking toilet paper wasn t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors there were no information screens so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board boarding itself was efficient with priority for groups and seats j k on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job and at least there s plenty of storage space in the window bins take off was on schedule fas went through the motions with little enthusiasm the food was the worst we ve ever experienced in club world the smoked chicken salad was atrocious and the scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors the white company bedding was a let down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts there s little one can do to remedy a hard seat landing was ahead of schedule overall a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub par business class product british airways are falling ever behind their competitors 
1102, gatwick to san jose i ve just stepped onto a ba flight from gatwick to costa rica an hr flight and can honestly i haven t seen a screen with so few pixels since the s i fly other long haul flights and none of ba s competitors are providing such low quality entertainment i used to think of british airways as being a premium airline now they re just rubbish 
1103, i took the new option of the new toronto to london gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route cheaper than the heathrow service it was an interesting experiment in whether i could fall back in love with gatwick excellent check in at pearson as usual but spoiled by the third party lounge goodness knows what ba were thinking given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options the premium plaza lounge is cheap and nasty on time boarding on a near empty flight too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up the cabin was a third full juice and water offered no prosecco in premium economy though the crew member couldn t explain why it s not offered to london but why champagne in biz is manageable on time departure and a fast drinks service this is my first experience of gatwick crew fast sociable less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving heathrow and all over the meal was vile overcooked salty and dry as the plane was empty i went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing ife on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at christmas an early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight returning i liked the biz first class check in area at lgw fast and friendly the lounge at gatwick was streets ahead of heathrow self serve champagne and loads of seats kept very clean and plenty of food an upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight efficient boarding and a fast coat drink and menu service a really fast bar service only mins in with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from heathrow the only thing that spoilt it was off duty ba staff in biz chatting and distracting the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight the gatwick s are old very old with no power in premium economy currently going through a refurb progamme but with efficient and friendly crew and on time early performance there was little to dislike and i even liked gatwick 
1104, first time flying with british airways in economy on a transatlantic flight from london to chicago i was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly flight attendants they walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals snacks and drinks of all kinds i will definitely fly british overseas again given a chance the economy seats on this old but well kept boeing were very comfortable and i am a x lbs and still did not feel cramped i would encourage all my friends to fly british if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the us to europe thank you british airways very good service indeed 
1105, geneva to vancouver via london worst experience terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered voucher and no apology an insult as did not ask for compensation it s an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline on a positive point the geneva to london flights were fine but the long haul flights to vancouver were abysmal 
1106, this is the first time i have flown ba s club europe flying from london heathrow to corfu i was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however i was very pleasantly surprised shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a course meal which was very tasty i had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate we were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne the crew were very attentive and helpful they had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past the seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine this flight was an upgrade using avios and i would happily do it again i paid around avios and an extra in taxes which i think was very good value for what i had 
1107, our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically re booked on a flight the next day to london heathrow this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick i managed to get through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day we were offered no other assistance by the airline the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running minutes late having eventually boarded the aircraft we stayed at the gate for about minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours so we would be given water this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice so no water was served the real horror of this flight however was british airways new food service whereby passengers buy food and pay by card avios this simply does not work after one hour in the air the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley about minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps potato chips he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can which we duly shared between us having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours this was the only refreshment we could obtain i consider this to be completely unacceptable if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airways there is no point traveling with them the budget airlines can do better at lower cost 
1108, hong kong to london this was my first business class trip on ba as i mostly use emirates or cathay pacific in comparison ba offers a very low standard the flight attendant who served the section where i was seated couldn t have cared less no greetings when passengers boarded the plane no offer of help he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink no second drink was offered the toilet hadn t been cleaned properly before boarding and during the flight one of the two washrooms became unusable resulting in long queues the seating arrangement having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction is uncomfortable overall appalling quality and little value for money 
1109, washington to bucharest return via london i was originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles check in was offered a club world upgrade at just more which i accepted resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top drawer service the two london bucharest sectors both went well but all this was just a prelude to my return trip while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i wasn t seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage at the bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance which i accepted and was promptly wheeled through security passport control and the very long corridors to the gate then put aboard the plane on arrival in london i was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t and onto the plane this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade this time for free once on the plane back to washington the cabin crew couldn t do enough for me checking how i was doing going through meal choices the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items i really can t eat but ultimately i still ate well getting me drinks and more they were as professional and proactive a crew as i ve ever experienced in years of long haul travel finally once arrived at dulles more assistance was waiting right up to getting my cab what could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined through the years i ve had mostly excellent experiences with ba cabin crews and that s a big reason why i ve stayed with ba all these years and will continue to do so but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above and beyond service you re the best 
1110, london to warsaw ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline the price of seat selection still remains high the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a hour flight you can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever someone is moving i didn t buy any food or drink onboard although i reckon it s not badly priced the inbound flight was on an older a in which the seat was reclining 
1111, london to istanbul due to poor weather conditions at lhr the flight was initially delayed by hours which is quite understandable when the passengers were informed of the gate everyone gathered at the a gate in t then no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own next there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate everyone rushes to the one of the last of the c gates once on board the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour the flight finally takes off nearly three hours late after a while the crew comes with the m s gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and i had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner the flight arrived in istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal 
1112, london to cape town flying first class with british airways is a hit or miss affair but having secured a couple of return flights to cape town with avios our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking unfortunately terminal isn t the best starting point and galleries first lacks glamour or decent champagnes the food on offer is adequate although hardly first class hoping for better on board we didn t use the sit down menu boarding was on time and according to ba s new group allocation our seats k and k were a first for us as we ve previously gone for pairs in the centre but seats a and k are definitely superior with more storage space and better privacy however there s no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley the ife is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade but at least it didn t require rebooting on our flight cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job food was better than usual although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait minutes for our hot breakfast landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within minutes overall a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane 
1113, london to hamburg typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg using their avios points i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at per direction their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the american premium class not lounge all the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs people jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections boarding was like a cattle call ba flies one of its oldest b into miami and it showed even in first the seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet the service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of california the flight was late leaving and late arriving and this miami flight does not dock in terminal rather terminal and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what i did for my connection to hamburg in the end i decided i was done with ba because their service model for premium passengers has hit rock bottom their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines try using ba points on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try 
1114, turin to london gatwick rubbish check in service as bad as ryanair i show the staff my mobile boarding pass checked website that i have x kg bags checked allowance one bag was over kg they refused to honour the kg allowance and told me i will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in they were so rude and unhelpful boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner flight was delayed without the checked in agent saying anything after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather at the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait 
1115, when i checked in the evening before for the am flight it looked like only of seats were occupied hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanation there is not a hotline to call 
1116, ba s reputation has been declining for years so i don t use them for various reasons i had to for a flight for madrid i had hand luggage they texted asking for the hand luggage to be checked in as the flight was busy i did and they lost it hours later no luggage or idea where it is no compensation only after hours and for a small amount ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will lagging significantly behind easyjet in all aspects 
1117, los angeles to london heathrow desperately poor service from british airways in club class business class is utterly outdated with the weird facing each other configuration and narrow uncomfortable seats the food served was appalling the cabin crew were inattentive at best and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service the problem with british airways now in first and business class is what they are completely lacking namely any class or manners whatsoever poor food uncomfortable seats terrible small movie screens no wifi and an overall budget airline experience british airways even charge for seat selection too which adds insult to injury avoid this horrible airline if you can the only redeeming feature of this airline is the wonderful quiet airbus a a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude 
1118, london heathrow to mahon booked months ago flights for first family holiday for years for adults children and infant in lap almost k for all of us pre booked seats at the same time i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying about your flight to madrid on the th may when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca airline assured me everything was fine further concern when self service check in opened hours out wife and daughters checked in fine me and my son were referred to airport check in despite all being on the same booking an urgent call to ba i was told i was probably being moved to a bassinet position when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said infants can t check in online which i now understand is also incorrect my concern was well placed at ba t bag drop check in agent looked flustered a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre booked seats were gone my son and i had no seats at all and were standby and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin rows apart prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know after kicking up a huge fuss i believe they can t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents the check in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight fast forward to the gate utter carnage including the check in supervisor who cant have been more than in tears when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son again many rows apart from the rest of my family as this was my sons first ever flight i was absolutely livid that we couldn t sit anywhere near each other added to that my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding kids needing toilet etc i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff i even heard one of them mutter check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight fast forward another mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we re going to have to get off here and my children in tears much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found there were quite a few on the flight apparently and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight what seat raised a formal complaint and was told that they understand my frustration which is nice separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat conclusion is families avoid at all costs 
1119, dubai to london heathrow lovely flight and a great ba worldwide crew which are the best in the ba fleet very good seat with great extras that you would expect in st class chose to sleep as it was a night flight but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning baggage allowance was superb with x kg cases and cabin bags overall a lovely flight with a great airline that has a great crew
1120, london heathrow to singapore on may in this review i am reviewing the a la carte dining option on board for world traveller world traveller passengers have the option to pre order from a selection of main courses up to days in advance for selected long haul flights out of lhr with prices ranging from to i had the gourmet dining consisting of braised hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious if you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul ba flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route i highly recommend you to go for it 
1121, paris to newark flight cancelled this experience was one of the worst i ve had the engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine all air and water shut off for three hours not to mention the boeing looked ancient for a hour flight from paris i expected a little more the flight attendants did not keep us updated lastly after we got off the plane they had one receptionist at the desk to deal with the people who needed to rebook flights and get hotels for the night will never fly british airways again delta forever 
1122, i flew ba from heraklion to gatwick i bought exit row seats for me and others to sit together with extra leg room i paid around for that in january we got to the airport hours before departure queued to check in and was told that of the seats were reallocated to someone else i asked why the ba rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed she then said we should have got there earlier she wouldn t call ba customer service when i showed her the email acknowledging of us were given row bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch i was told to email ba and ask them to refund me the seat cost the flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane she apologised and said she d take our case up with ba customer service i also sent in a complaint today is days with no response and my money still not refunded i ll never fly with them again 
1123, outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished was in economy all in all wasn t a bad experience modern looking cabin with excellent ife system food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to premium economy return flight ba was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worries could relax in the pe cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old was the plane the cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days a quick check and this particular was delivered to and hadn t had the refurbishment treatment leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the ife system that decided not to work mind you the screen was so small and scratched i doubt i would have been able to watch anything cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few words from the captain we departed the evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok wine and g t was acceptable about hour before landing breakfast was served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special for having spent an extra for the upgrade ba this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline never again 
1124, singapore to london this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a now this aircraft in qantas colours is one i am very familiar with having flown around sectors over the last months with qf as mentioned in my review of ba which was the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem the same comments for that review apply here the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content on qantas american cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies great music choices those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator brave heart roman holiday etc are all things we as passengers want to see some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff ife is one thing on long haul the other is food and beverage the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly on qantas say qf from singapore to london one gets the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found chocolates banana bread cheese and biscuits you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between the a is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and was a miserable flying on an a should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another that is sad given the stature of ba i came back on ba from london to hong kong and the same comments apply hard product is fine except for no snack bar but the soft product is lacking severely 
1125, sydney to london via singapore it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than hours last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in the years have not been kind to ba probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines the problem is not the hard product a b or the a in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame the b from sydney to singapore was fine nosier than the a but that is well known very comfortable seats and at hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home it is the soft product that is lacking check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security being a gold ff with qantas boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore now its just a lack of polish with the soft product no menu given showing what was to be served as with cathay emirates and qantas the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap kfc offers a better grade of plastic i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas the food itself was very bland a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert it s just the quality that is lacking drinks i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke this is available on qantas but no sir we don t serve that a note about the fa s they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver final word about this leg is the ife a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last years one or two interesting things and some new releases come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics as for music well i m but still like the pearl jams etc of the world we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago 
1126, malaga to gatwick operated by titan airways very full business class of people a sick flight attendant so just one female attendant handled alone i wish to highly commend here despite alone she managed perfectly 
1127, flew barcelona to gatwick this review is about the arrangement for check in rather than actual flight ba allows you to check in online but not to print out a boarding card there was no machine to print a card queue taking minutes to get boarding card and several people were too late for check in there were desks for priority for general check in for all flights only desk served once they were about to close check in
1128, munich to london heathrow with british airways while british airways is more or less in the same price range as lufthansa no complimentary food or drinks were served crew was friendly the departure was from terminal in munich which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal and arrival at terminal in heathrow which is not as nice easy as the new star alliance queens terminal no wifi personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flight seat reservation too expensive in my eyes british airways has one big advantage though the generous hand luggage rules 
1129, this was an early morning flight from heathrow to keflavik the flight was not very full shortly after take off the cabin crew came around to sell m s snacks and drinks reasonably priced this was a typical intra european flight on british airways where food and drinks are for sale cabin crew were efficient i had the exit row seat so leg room was more than adequate 
1130, cape town to london dated aircraft very poor cabin service semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor journey the cabin crew clearly regarded us as an intrusion and i do not feel that i should be having to ask for a drink with my main meal surely we should have been offered something as a matter of course i used to be happy to pay more to fly ba now i pay extra not to 
1131, washington to prague via london i have flown them several times in the past but not for a number of years i remember them as not a top of the line airline but better than average this time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped hot towels as you neared your destination and they have become almost a low fare airline you pay for reserving seats on shorter flights you pay for food etc the seating on the boeing seemed very cramped it is said to be but seemed like less on the return flight on may rd two of the lavatories went out of service the a from london to prague seemed to have more seat room but the seats were very hard they may be the new slimline seats i m not sure but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight also on the washington to lhr flight we had printed out boarding passes at home the agent at washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife it was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home i won t say that i will not fly them again but i will definitely compare prices in the future they aren t worth any extra cost 
1132, london to washington apart from the space nothing nothing was first class not even the comfort crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach food which used to be fantastic is just eatable no more wines which were the best in the sky when jancis robinson and hugh johnson made the selection apart from a good white champagne but mediocre ros are at the level of a business class and my seat did not have sound from the audio video system so they moved me and an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing needless to say no wifi apart from their lhr first and concorde room lounges at lhr which remain great ba is now no better than a star airline sad for the clients and shameful for ba management 
1133, i had called the british airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at london heathrow from washington dulles to glasgow i was told that clearing border control would be done at final destination at glasgow but this was not true passengers arriving into london heathrow from international and connecting to domestic flights have to clear uk border control long lines and then security screen again before gaining access to flights even with mobility assistance and a fast track card and minutes between flights it was a close call to make connections 
1134, london to montreal i did my online check in the night before and left to go to the airport i arrived at the airport hours in advance went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and the kiosk wasn t working so i proceeded to the ba counter to get my pass and check in my luggage i was in line for approximately minutes when we were all told to switch lines the line we were moved to was substantially longer however i was patient by the time i got to the desk an hour had passed and i had a bit over an hour left to my flight i figured this was tight but all the while manageable since i trusted ba s system the woman at the counter asked me where i was going and when i said montreal she looked at me and said you won t make it i explained the situation how i had been in the airport for several hours already and that i was in line for hour she just told me i needed to go to the missed flight counter i got to the counter and they informed me that i had to buy a new return ticket my original return ticket cost me my return cost me i had no choice but to buy the ticket i also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to gatwick airport the following morning once i arrived back in montreal i called ba customer services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket and that i could get a refund if not for the new flight then for the of the flight i missed imagine my shock after spending an additional cad all in when i escalated my complaint they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you and that was that 
1135, tokyo to amsterdam via london on the evening before departure i received an email from ba the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn t be a delay in the end the aircraft left tokyo haneda with a minutes delay baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with japanese politeness if you have the choice to fly from nrt or hnd i would definitely choose hnd because it s much more conveniently located to downtown tokyo the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft adding more time to the delay we already had i didn t like the seats on the i found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you on the window and aisle seats there s also the ife box so there s no place for both feet the meal was a joke and there was no choise inflight entertainment is not up to date small screens with low brightness the crew was not very friendly when i went to the galley for a drink i was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs the second meal service was rushed we ve got our meals and after minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to lhr luckily i ve made it to my connecting flight to amsterdam because i had a short connection the a flight to amsterdam departed ahead of schedule there s nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice unfortunately ba decided to cut the the service on european flights in the race to the bottom 
1136, check in at vienna airport was painless ba uses air lounge at vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to club europe passengers the flight wasn t full therefore service was quite prompt i found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to the food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches one passenger wasn t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was business class was quite average to be honest will fly club europe again maybe depending on which route and price ba has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within europe 
1137, took a day trip to vienna with british airways booked at the last minute flying out at on a sunday and having an early start to get to the airport i was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight having never usually been a problem i boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers only business freezing temperature onboard the aircraft so managed to get limited sleep another example of ba s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non existence of customer service within the airline despite it being one of the first flights out of heathrow with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions we still managed to arrive about minutes late into vienna quite as to how is beyond me i ll be sticking to easyjet until british airways once again starts to value it s passengers as currently they couldn t care less 
1138, glasgow to heathrow ba are a disgrace it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high my flight from islay was delayed by hours no fault of mine so i missed my connecting flight after being fobbed off as not my fault nothing we can do i ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again i had to pay for another flight money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling
1139, london to phoenix this week having a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and rest this was successful on the flight with hours slept which was super comfortable which i was surprised at the meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for ba the poorest part of the trip is the tv being so small and picture so poor in the end couldn t really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues i e press pause and film would start from beginning would i fly again sure why not 
1140, glasgow to heathrow very disappointed in british airways having been delayed by a partner airline and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve ba charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my ba exec club membership so i d had to book it as two flights neither ba or loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night clearly being a member of the ba exec club counts for nothing very bad customer service ba seems ba and loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers 
1141, brussels to shanghai via london heathrow all flights on time clean aircraft food good cabin crew friendly i recommend british airways the only complaint i have is about the ground staff at heathrow i lost my jacket on the shanghai to london flight and ground staff at heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects 
1142, chicago to london heathrow i was dubious about flying ba especially after my last flight over a year ago after which i left the aircraft feeling very hungry however my trip to usa with ba was surprisingly very good both ways on this flight after deciding not to spend on an upgrade i was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room didn t feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once although i slept a lot of the way the cabin crew were very helpful even asking the captain to find the direction of mecca so i could pray in my seat was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee i had to ask for both but was given without any fuss a is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent although i noticed a funny not that loud motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey for dinner there was butter chicken rice and lentils and a rice pudding type desert all of which was okay nothing special 
1143, athens to philadelphia via london i chose ba because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a hour minute flight ath to lhr they do not serve food and beverages free on the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats there was no waste envelope whilst my inflight magazine was so overused lhr to phl an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way rather poor lunch i was disappointed with ba especially with their decision to charge for f b on european flights 
1144, hong kong to london heathrow on b in club world this was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to hk on an a on cathay pacific and the difference was huge the ba club world cabin is very cramped when compared with cathay the seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped the duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off this is fare enough but there is little room they also provide bottle of water which is great but again little storage area the food service was also disappointing the duck breast as my main course was very tough drinks selection was very good plus points go to the cabin crew who were very professional and had a sense of humour understand ba plan to change the business class seating in and this cannot come soon enough 
1145, los angeles to london heathrow return outbound first class return club world a both sectors awesome aircraft firstly ba flight deck crews are awesome totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots the cabin crew on both sectors were polite friendly and professional their service was excellent i wasn t feeling well on the out bound flight and i didn t eat anything so i can t comment on the food on the return flight in club world the food was very good no complaints there the seats were comfortable although the club world cabin felt cramped i was in k which is a window rear facing bulk head seat as it was a daytime flight the noise coming from the galley didn t bother me but i think it would be an issue on night flights i hope ba change their business class seating for something like aa business class on their s ba business class is really dated and i said it felt cramped my big issue and this isn t entirely ba s fault was the over zealous security screening at heathrow i was pulled aside for screening times i don t mind extensive in depth security but to be screened times was excessive i am enrolled in and pay for tsa pre check and if british airways would participate in this program it would save a lot of angst other than that the overall ba experience was totally acceptable 
1146, hamburg to abu dhabi via london hamburg to heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candy everything is for purchase i felt cheated heathrow terminal was a big mass getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over hr within the same terminal security screening was extremely slow and staff rude i will avoid heathrow in the future long flight to abu dhabi was ok no frills in premium economy but edible food return flight was similar but heathrow terminal less chaotic this time my last flight on ba was over years ago it was a real premium carrier then 
1147, overnight club world flight from rio to london check in at rio was efficient third party lounge premium plaza which was reasonable and had enough space no fast track security lanes in rio plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding on board standard club world service my feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be granted they only loaded one of the wine options which was wasn t great either food itself not terribly appetizing breakfast quite rushed which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight flight landed on time priority bags worked and were off quickly an average experience however ba were not the lowest cost option on this route at the time of booking that was air france a carrier i rate highly but they were a direct flight 
1148, london heathrow to vancouver the on this route is an old worn out aircraft even though i paid for premium economy the seat was hard small and uncomfortable it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off the touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working the washroom had a leak and when i used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said i shouldn t have worn socks there was no accessory pack of eye shades etc out of two meal choices one had run out after two rows had been served the crew appeared bored and not bothered 
1149, madrid to london credit where it s due flew club europe and the crew were excellent friendly attentive and professional the food was a good standard the b has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service 
1150, venice to gatwick i use snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened together to allow skiers to check in one bag only in feb of this year i was told by ba check in staff in venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together the staff were clear that it is ba policy that bags cannot be fastened together for nearly three months i have been asking the ba complaints team to provide evidence of this baggage policy i have had several replies in that time but on each occasion the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in venice ba has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact ba employees or employed by a third party this is very disappointing in what was a reputable company 
1151, first legs were trouble free lounges were good some staff were good some were very poor especially the agent i encountered at security in lhr my flight from singapore was delayed in the air and i was not allowed onto my connecting flight british airways re booked me on the next flight but downgraded me from business to economy and into a centre seat fine i wanted to get home and they said they would compensate me after weeks they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket but i was not entitled to any even token gesture of frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat after a long haul flight i missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep it was all handled very poorly late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via air france or one of the middle east carriers who value my business its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and i will certainly look at flying with other carriers now 
1152, flew london to budapest with british airways massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like ryanair or easyjet with no real added value no drinks or food served on the flight the check in process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well a bit more legroom but that won t justify the price difference on a hr flight 
1153, paid for a vueling airlines flight from florence to gatwick and bumped off flight when called british airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though i bought the ticket from ba com and had one flight number ba a shocking attitude towards their paying customer 
1154, london to sao paulo overnight club world flight prompt check in at heathrow and into lounge no spaces at the spa galleries lounges were fine and showers clean good wifi aircraft was a so in flight entertainment was good they also had wifi on board crew experienced and were good service prompt food reasonable and i liked the new white company offerings flight arrived early generally a solid performance 
1155, worst ba flight ever flew tampa to london gatwick no greeting by the door shown to economy despite business seat dirty plane bits dangling from the ceiling only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier probably the worst business class seat around wobbly footrest facing strangers and having to climb over people breakfast was a single meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup at disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers that was left to other passengers crew just stood there economy was not held back so no priority disembarkation never again 
1156, flew british airways from london heathrow to dusseldorf despite being row legroom was tiny no comparison to say eurowings which is a budget airline food terrible even worse was the seat this is not business class one expects a degree of comfort next time i will fly eurowings and get decent leg room with a table i can actually work on 
1157, madrid to london the main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly and hard working the i saw no food in the iberia lounge at madrid no working washrooms and discourteous iberia staff the food on board was ludicrous in business i got a panini the staff looked embarrassed to serve it waste of money 
1158, london to moscow british airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in business class is no longer club world flat bed seat but club europe seat not flat bed it is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable i cannot fly during the day as i have meetings scheduled ba has not offered a like for like change they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that ba is offering during the day they also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date like friday when the seat whether club world or club europe is less important as saturday not a working day and one can get a rest in summary it is unacceptable that ba is charging more for the flights with club world seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change this was never the case before and ba was fair previously 
1159, miami to london my most recent ba experience was positive i fly ba for work and leisure up to long haul flights a year on my most recent flight from miami to lhr i found the whole economy experience well above average despite the dated aircraft the which to me is the legend of the skies the cabin crew in economy were smart attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service from the mia ground handling american crew food and beverage service was good seating in my aisle seat e generous for my long legs i recently flew ba business club world to the far east for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight well done ba you excel against the north american carriers on routes to the north american gateways who give just a basic service 
1160, gatwick to barbados in december on a hour flight they provided one meal and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars bar and a cup of tea the plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surly the only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors but still not cheap 
1161, london heathrow to dallas the aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last years or so seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight the personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen so i had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable the choice of ife is very limited the food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion i saw some passengers request for more food and i was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude i must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to from jfk i had an onward connecting flight with american airlines and i can clearly see the changes between the airlines over the past few years whilst aa is improving ba is becoming a national embarrassment ba remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection the seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines it no longer deserves a star rating but edging between or star it s not even worth redeeming avios points anymore these days i d rather spend my avios on partner airlines 
1162, decided to go in club europe for this relatively short flight minutes from london to copenhagen dropped my bags and went through security which did not take too long i then went to the galleries lounge south and although i have not been there for a year or two it looked the same same food same drinks same slow wifi my gate was just around the corner and i got on the plane i like the fresh look inside but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business the food service was disappointing the service in the cabin was ok but not very warm i have travelled a lot with ba over the past years after yesterda i have lost my faith in british airways 
1163, ba used to be a byword for quality and service you simply can t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price i paid dollars for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba for that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note this is a hour flight also screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight so no alternative of watching movies on your ipad oh and you ll have to buy any food and drinks on board i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me however turkish airlines is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meals and a modern entertainment system pegasus and atlasglobal offer a similar service to ba but at far lower prices it seems to be the same all over ba used to be a first choice but at this price for this service it s become a last resort 
1164, premium economy worse than most airlines economy unprofessional staff uncomfortable seats foot rest but no leg rest very little seat recline and difficult to operate rubbish food very poor landing and everything went flying additionally we were a family of travelling together but split up and of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve people these premium economy seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light not ba even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup this was the second leg on a flight from sydney via lax so we were beyond tired when an attendant picked up my son s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight he didn t hear my son say thanks which he had so the attendant said pointedly you re welcome rude and laughed about it with the passenger next to him in my experience better and cheaper premium economy can be found with norwegian air new zealand and american airlines all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge i ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with british airways i ve never had a good experience 
1165, flew belfast to london with british airways stressful day started with a hours delay for the morning flight at am as an apology they sold us the food and the drinks yes they asked for money even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours seriously if you can find an alternative to travel within the uk do it not very countable if you have a connected flight 
1166, naples to gatwick the online check in would not work for me in accordance with the one world frequent flyer policy i am a qantas frequent flyer and so i ought to have had the chance to check in a few days ahead of the flight the ba website would not let me do so the bag drop in naples was slow and seemed rather random boarding was tedious i should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card in the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage the cabin crew were quite indifferent i greeted cabin crew when i boarded and neither of them smiled back i bought a marks and spencer drink at an inflated price one of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when i went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger disembarkation was slow and badly managed nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers ba has become a low cost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag i will not be using them again in a hurry 
1167, i have been flying with ba for the last years between sao paulo and london on and off but mostly ba i have travelled in all classes except first ba used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares not value for money the food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink even in business i flew out club and returned economy plus staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude no changes there boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in different queues of travel so we have become just a number service is not exclusive anymore seats on the wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on club their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety in case of food allergies intolerances really bad and of poor quality it is a shame singapore airlines doesn t fly to brazil from the uk as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class ba has become mean greedy and indifferent to their customers and i feel it is time for the ceo to go as he is ruining the image of the airline the changes on baggage weight has become silly also i was allowed two luggages of kg any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at kg and one of kg as i haven t go above the allowance i am entitled instead i had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it and in my opinion unnecessary as i had kgs in total and not kg so i will in future re think my trips to brazil even if i have to make my journey longer as i am after good service value for money and a differentiated experience thumbs down to ba 
1168, i traveled on british airways with my wife from dallas to lagos nigeria via london on february i had an extra bag that i paid for in dallas our flight got delayed in dallas therefore we missed our flight to lagos when we got to london we went to the ba counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a virgin atlantic flight to lagos on getting to virgin atlantic counter we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from ba we decided to do that i opened a case on ba website explaining what happened and requested for a refund as what happened was their fault and not mine they refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy i know this but what happened was not my fault but theirs that was the last time i heard from them on the issue even the economy premium was a waste of money nothing special such a disappointment never again 
1169, flew british airways from budapest to london heathrow quite possibly the worst flight i have ever had and i travel often generally when we travel we try to pack our hand baggage light as we check our heavier bags and it s more convenient for other passengers too my partner and i had briefcase sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker as more passengers boarded most with as large as possible carryons the overhead lockers filled up the flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads takes out our bags hands them to us and says i m sorry but the space is needed for large bags telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us reducing our leg room to zero how is this at all fair i questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry ons and was given the response that i would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded i have no idea who at ba thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean thank you for bringing smaller carry ons than everyone else as a measure of our appreciation we ll take away your leg room the general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention young adults barely out of high school and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services starbucks such was their experience at providing pleasant service what a sad state of affairs i will never ever travel british airways willingly again long haul or short haul i would rather take a civilised one stop journey with lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct british airways flight 
1170, the air conditioning didn t work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot i had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler it was an hours flight from london heathrow to new york jfk overall the airplane was old with little space to seat there was no wi fi the leg seating space was very small i wish that food would be more taste neutral if your child doesn t like spicy or flavored foods snacks there would be nothing to eat the stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding landing was smooth the ba staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on there are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in and these boxes are very small also the airport security was overly zealous they had to search kids bag and they found roll on deodorant and checked it for fumes 
1171, my bag was damaged on a ba flight in december all looked good when i got to the airport customer services counter was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call i called this number when home and it s a rd party company called k they will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used i raised this with ba who refused to offer like for like replacement i got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times months later i decide that something is better than nothing and call k to get the bag they offered me only to find that ba have closed my case and they won t send one finally get through to ba and they finally agree to put me back to k to get the bag offered if i want to upgrade what they offer i will have to pay it myself i wont hold my breath but it is supposed to arrive on tuesday i would not fly again unless i had no other viable option 
1172, efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight decided to opt for premium economy as only hour flight from london heathrow to cairo galleries south lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good showers clean and well presented chaotic boarding well presented aircraft staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink slightly delayed departure time made up en route unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable efficient staff and good inflight entertainment happy with whole experience i don t think i would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you don t need to sleep it was fine 
1173, st lucia to gatwick as this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and i now wish we d saved the extra that it cost a complete waste of money the cabin is very dated and cramped it wasn t clean half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor and the service and food were average at best why in this day and age do ba persist with having seats with no direct aisle access not that i could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway the seat was adequate and no more the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky needing very firm contact to get any response on top of this there was no usb point to charge my phone i expected better cabin service than we got not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it i certainly don t expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested minutes earlier all in all it was an education certainly taught me a lesson 
1174, fort lauderdale to gatwick an efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals terminal to the international terminal terminal check in was friendly security staff insisted on using a whole body scanner for everyone and were overly officious surprisingly there was no business class lounge although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance club world was in two smaller cabins with the usual outdated eight seats abreast take off was on time the wrong menus had been loaded so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy drinks and food service served efficiently food adequate and not overcooked but below the standard of turkish airlines seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat abbreviated breakfast no hot option served an hour before landing arrived mins ahead of schedule overall an adequate flight but the inflight experience was well below ba s competitors 
1175, dubai to london heathrow it s bad that ba requests additional payment to select seats before the check in if flying solo it s not a big issue but with any companion in this case i was with my son of it would have been an issue to be separate this also means that if there are or flights and a group of two as in my case the difference would be substantial up to approx lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn t full on board service was decent professional courteous and friendly attendants toilets in the second half of the flight weren t too clean flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep the aircraft did not have wifi 
1176, london to las vegas disappointed at ba flights were delayed my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by hrs aircraft interior was outdated unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space no safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this food was tasteless and i did skip a meal in the end during one of the snack times we weren t given the options by our fa but the guy sat next to us who was served by another fa was given different options inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old to ensure that i sit with my partner on the return flight we paid to reserve our seats not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke ife box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor learnt our lessons next time we will not fly ba 
1177, tampa to gatwick i am a disabled traveller with considerable mobility issues as i usually travel alone i can find it extremely difficult however from the moment i arrived at the check in desk in tampa i was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance from the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional i was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door every person was polite helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible i witnessed such kindness and this is what i have come to expect and value from british airways having used other airlines in the past i am converted i will not use any other airline in future 
1178, heathrow to keflavik i had booked economy was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when i checked in online priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range the inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine off loading was straightforward the return flight was on time the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat m s food service was ok the cabin crews were slow at taking payment overall similar experience to an easyjet flight 
1179, london to muscat first class first time trying out first class on ba check in was fairly quick and efficient didn t have much luggage but the first wing did not feel very exclusive i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass concorde room was nice well designed but quite crowded in some places had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace before it got served a good minutes later checkout out the cabana for an hour which was not very appealing at all and managed to miss the first min of the min treatment i booked for the spa onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected and was issued a new aisle seat which was disappointing upon entering the first class cabin i had a quick look at the seat and it was not immediately apparent there was something wrong i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there but there was no explanation of what was wrong given i did not want to waste any time to settle in the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private with a small wardrobe to hang jacket the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive and neither was the remote for the tv soon after take off i was informed i could eat when i like arabic starter was great had pre selected main meal online meal was of good quality and cooked well had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate not as good as other cheese i ve had in some business class surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection i imagine on two ultra long flights in the same month one might run out of anything of interest to watch after finishing the one film i decided to watch i decided to try get some sleep crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough i missed breakfast as i was still rather full from the dinner and pre dinner at the lounge overall i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product the crew were very friendly and professional given this was first class have to admit there was no wow factor either with the soft product or ground experience i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight 
1180, my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the th march we have a year old and a year old once seated we realised that our entertainment system was not working the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this as it was a night flight my wife and i had to see to our year old in the dark any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video we didn t receive this the flight was the worst airline experience we ve had i doubt i ll ever fly with ba again 
1181, gatwick to madeira the flight left on time and arrived early slept as early morning flight the plane was not very clean grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats the staff were pleasant breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate the return was poorly organised no use of fast track security for business class passengers long queue for boarding and a grubby plane really no point in paying for business class the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly hours and no entertainment dog eared magazines quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration 
1182, london to casablanca their customer service quality in heathrow terminal is very patchy for background my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled then rebooked to ba my second flight had further issue and instead of requesting tap to rebook me ba took the liberty of rebooking a rd flight for me which turned out to be overbooked this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my th flight i was tossed around by both customer care telling me it s not their problem tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the rd flight i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked however later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was minutes past their end of shift they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba this is very rude and extremely unprofessional i ve never had this treatment during my years of flying with various airlines both top rated and low cost carrier 
1183, british airways flight manager is very professional i travelled on ba from berlin to hong kong via london on feb due to the snowy weather my flight leaving berlin to london was delayed in which i was worried about missing my connecting flight from london to hong kong during the flight the manager came to me several times explained to me the reason of flight delay informed me about the connecting flight arrangements her information was very clear trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this very much appreciated for their service 
1184, hyderabad to brussels via london didn t expect this from british airways for me quality hit the rock bottom especially the unclean flight i would have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think it s not worth it other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british airways 
1185, london gatwick to fort lauderdale is one of ba s new long haul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers from september the gatwick fleet will be densified with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced club world the on our flight was of the bog standard s vintage which meant pax squeezed into the club world cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient small screen low resolution ife that required the usual rebooting but there were positive aspects to the flight a young and efficient cabin crew the improved club world food service with plates brought individually to one s seat and arrival ahead of schedule although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation that s commonplace at fort lauderdale terminal overall an entirely reasonable flight 
1186, milan to london heathrow the service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at ba i am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passion the response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane 
1187, london to helsinki business class friday rd march i thought service in the sky had died out as a frequent flyer i haven t felt the needed to complain nor commend until now i had to say something to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights i have ever had this is old school airline service puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel cabin staff made me feel like i was the only person they were serving i loved the humour the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes 
1188, london heathrow to denver words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure i was comfortable on my latest flight but here it goes i was very sick nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off british airways literally nursed me back to health they were beyond wonderful and were genuinely caring and concerned i never once felt like a burden even though they were checking on me often world class crew again so thankful for people like this especially in my time of need and would highly recommend this airline to everyone 
1189, it was a hours flight from heathrow to kuala lumpur with british airways and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served during the dinner i was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake for the breakfast the flight was minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals up until minutes before landing they were still serving i waited for my turn but no food came so i asked instead of them explaining and apologising i had to ask where is my food they said that they ran out of food because they only cater for of the passengers assuming some will be asleep the cabin crew were very nice he apologised and passed me a feedback form which i have filled in while i understand that this airline does not want to waste food and i liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for hours also it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew i thought they should have their own it was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least minutes and out it came a cabin crew very interesting experience 
1190, worst business class i flew you are facing a stranger for the entire flight also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face dreadful food a very dated plane and uninterested staff the bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food they also ran out of the appetiser i was told sorry we ran out of satay and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option 
1191, beijing to london service at the british airways business class counter at beijing airport was pleasant the business lounge was quiet when we were there however food options were very limited we were there in the morning the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options onboard service was really good quite personal and attentive which made a difference from the service on the way out to beijing food was as good a you d expect to get on board i managed to get a window seat which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board entertainment options were good 
1192, london to beijing left from t at heathrow service is very speedy you can use the fast track entrance which is swift i didn t think much of the business lounge food was more like canteen food we were there around lunchtime i ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps later around pm they brought out some sandwiches this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime there were many drinks available wine was ok i tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working this was also disappointing with regards to the service on board the flight it was ok however they collected my breakfast card but not my husbands so he nearly missed out on breakfast the next morning they offered my husband a bread roll but not me it seemed there was not much structure to the service which meant they missed things the entertainment that was available was good 
1193, bangkok to london the worst long haul carrier i have flown with a very disappointing experience starting with the booking customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy the flights served the worst food the boeing i flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones portable devices the seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for hours when i mentioned to the onboard staff i was hungry i was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful the dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens 
1194, food on this hours flight from moscow to heathrow was a filled roll and cup of tea coffee the other london moscow flights provide a full meal the cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers when the flight touched down it was minutes before we disembarked british airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then minutes for an air bridge operator my email to their ceo produced nothing except a plastic apology even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation used to be ba was a world leader they ve followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction 
1195, flew london heathrow to delhi airport terminal concorde room is impressive clean but lacks service had to wait for over mins for waiting staff to come and attend when boarding the plane no one to escort you to the seat as you know there are only first class seats in b when it comes to meal choice the main course i had selected non veg indian dish was not available when questioned why i was told sorry today we only loaded of those dishes and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option so i skipped the main meal i reminded the stewardess that i am not an upgrade passenger i paid full price it is shame that ba is flying with less than food choice for their premium passengers i have never faced this situation with virgin or emirate and have decided never to fly with ba if i can help 
1196,none
1197, london to belfast another regular flight by british airways which has turned into a low cost airline given the total no frills service they provide the staff are extremely nice and polite but in the short haul flights you only get luggage the flight went perfectly departing and arriving on time 
1198, very full flight on g bnlp b flying from miami to london according to basource com this plane was built in obviously since then it was not refurbished felt like a teenager again worn seats cracks in the walls and dirty additonally the ife did not work at the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment as the night approached crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights no ife and no book reading possible crew were young and friendly but obviously not experienced took hours until we had our meal after take off they skipped our last four rows only after inquiring we got a tray on arrival new contractor at terminal and no jetbridge driver available needed to wait minutes until someone arrived overall poor experience with british airways they used to be good but they try to be low cost and charge legacy carrier prices will not work to fly to serve is no more adequate as their slogan 
1199, warsaw to london waw is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control bolero is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport ba have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly seat in club europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch frankly it s pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats the service was very good attentive and prompt the food served was also good with a choice of main course appetizer desert and cheese course with drinks flowing frankly well above expected 
1200, i booked my flight with cathay pacific the route between stockholm and london was operated by british airways for a hour flight they do not offer anything free on board there was no individual screen or usb charge at the seat for this short european flight 
1201, flew british airways from lisbon to london heathrow uneventful flight the crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there they should smile and be a little more considerate however the check in lady was nice and we had a laugh my problem with ba for a while now is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights 
1202, singapore to heathrow i skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal the air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came when i asked another air steward for a bottle of water he told me they don t have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight 
1203, chicago to chennai via london the pilot and captain were top class the flight was delayed by more than hours but they made it up to hours and was smooth chicago check in staff unfriendly it took them minutes to serve of us the only thing they tried was to upsell me into first class meals excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business my co passenger asked for a menu answer you are booked for veg meal so that will be served he asked for drinks menu answer what do you want the seat was claustrophobic closed and uncomfortable the crew was unsmiling 
1204, flew london heathrow to toronto i am a frequent traveller but this was the first time i have traveled with british airways and it did not disappoint me the flight departed on time and caused no extra delays whatsoever despite the dreadful weather conditions in toronto the cabin crews were wonderful and the service were great the seat aren t the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too 
1205, i flew british airways from heathrow to hong kong in club world on a a they have recently introduced the new club world service on this route and it was a complete disaster it took hours and minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight they ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold the cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didn t seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new ba concept doesn t seem to work well it was even criticised by the crew during the flight i am gold on ba and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future 
1206, i flew british airways from miami to heathrow on an airbus a the premium economy cabin is located on the upper deck i had a side seat with no one sitting next to me boarding was smooth and we left on time food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which i didn t eat my dog liked it when i got home for the price you would expect a better meal ife was fine crew good 
1207, london to phoenix decided to pay to travel first class for a big birthday upon arrival at terminal for check in i was disappointed to see no separate check in just a young girl with a couldn t care less attitude behind a temporary room divider off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious uninterested staff on the door huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago the lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good on board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first was followed by a filthy seat a screen that wouldn t stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me our return in club from new orleans was not much better no separate check in no lounge but a voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest i love ba onboard crew in general but i will never fly ba again 
1208, london to istanbul flying in ba s club europe is a miserable experience and i think they have the lowest standard of all european airlines the seats are economy class seats with no legroom the only difference is that the middle seat is kept free service and food are mediocre when will ba get its act together and return to acceptable standards 
1209, i have traveled several times with british airways but only in long haul trips those have been pretty good this time i had to fly from edinburgh to london gatwick and i end up with mix feelings ground service in edinburgh was outstanding expeditious friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge service on board was average but friendly departure was on time and we arrived minutes earlier so very well the plane was an airbus in pretty good shape clean and well maintained however the space between seats was simply ridiculous it was extremely small even for a midsize person there would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work happily the person in front of me did not recline that could have been a disaster very bad of course there was no entertainment there was food and beverages for purchase due to the space between seats i would avoid flying with ba in short haul flights 
1210, could british airways get any worse flew chicago london heathrow in upper deck club world of ancient b british airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry the seats are the crazy odd facing each other with a rude screen and are terribly uncomfortable narrow they must be at least a decade out of date the food wine was simply awful and they didn t have the lamb on the menu but replaced it with some kind of beef mush the crew were young uneducated and unprofessional they were waiters and waitresses at best and didn t seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people club class on this route was also full of screaming children one of whom threw up on the flight why do ba hold their premium customers in such contempt i can give you the answer they have a monopoly from the uk to the usa and back and no legitimate competition 
1211, flew on british airways from athens to london the aircraft was a boeing at the age of years the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time unfortunately ba has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but i guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive 
1212, the best thing about this flight from london heathrow to miami was it s punctuality however having got up at am for the flight time at if we hadn t eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service which was served what seemed like a long time after take off hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady aircraft an elderly and showing its age screen tiny scratched and hardly worth looking at we have flown similar routes on thomas cook and tui planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this ba flight which i think is shameful for the national carrier 
1213, i ve been flying to bombay for the last seven years to teach there for most of those seven years i have flown jet but decided to try ba this time terminal heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when i questioned one of the staff i was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago the flight was smooth the seat significantly more comfortable than jet s the food good and the service great the steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative in economy class i can only book my seat hours before takeoff i can book the seat of my choice earlier if i wish to pay and that was what i wanted to do with my avios points but you cannot i was told that several executive club members and avios point collectors had made the same complaint and that ba might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with avios points ba judging from this experience does not know whether it is a full exercise or a low cost airline 
1214, flew short haul business class with british airways manchester gothenburg via london heathrow it s a diffcult one to review some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable we used points to travel so what we paid was fine though would never pay a full ba business short haul fee we have family in sweden so took kgs gifts etc of luggage with us for our four night trip check in was fine both ends all fights on time just about and no luggage issues a positive the staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email publish our concerns we had a mixture of fortunes with the catering man lhr nice cold meat platter min flight lhr got three dried up finger sandwiches no alternative offered were told could not take from the m s menu in economy either one reason for this because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system i was told to change my profile details on ba site once home i looked it clearly says meal options none i e no special menu confusing to say the least thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights we were told in economy you had to purchase everything even water however if in an emergency tap water could be provided so much for a full service airline any newspapers also gone from business class on lhr got route there was no divide put up between business and economy so a free for all to the front toilet leg room not great even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat more than h in advance for the frist row and for the rest which is ridiculous if you had paid return lounges ok preferred man to lhr which is busy and looking worn already the down scaling of ba and the mix of pretending to be a full service airline but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on the fas were a saving grace though rest assured they are not happy we ll use up our existing points though definiately not our airline of choice 
1215, flew london heathrow to prague bad service had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze arrogant staff not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments i fly the route a few times a month british airways sometimes uses airport bus instead of air bridge and there are frequent delays what s the difference between ryanair and ba again please ah the price the only reason i give is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely 
1216, new orleans to hyderabad via london i booked my flight ticket couple of moths before my travel and i received an email on the day i m going to travel saying that my flight was cancelled and they asked me to book my ticket for the next day this destructed all my plans i have an interview to attend which is very important i gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any options after couple of hours over the call i am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from msy to dfw and london and hyd and the layover is very short and i am very tense as i don t have any options to choose this whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really bad 
1217, delayed hours on outbound flight to athens due to lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issues no tea or coffee offered while on business on that flight extremely dated aircraft meal offered was good cancelled inbound flight to london due to technical issues of aircraft hotel and compensation offered no entertainment during the next day s new flight in general british airways has no customer satisfaction anymore unfortunately i fly with them cause i have to it has become an unreliable average airline 
1218, a fairly average flight to cape town and return the old s they use out of gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable the tv screen is very small and fuzzy and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working but the selection of entertainment is ok the food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with british airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys as always with ba the crew were mixed some were helpful and really friendly others were borderline rude however i would probably still choose ba to cape town in order to fly direct 
1219, las vegas to london heathrow really poor food i am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he wouldn t eat what we were served the breakfast wrap of turkey bacon or mushroom and spinach they both smelt revolting and i didn t even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldn t eat anymore chicken curry was questionable or again spinach lasagne just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesn t mean they what spinach with every meal there are some very nice alternatives out there we were not offered tea or coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive i would think twice before traveling with ba again i thought they were meant to be our flagship airline 
1220, flew ba on february th from aberdeen to london heathrow check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process i really like the new group boarding structure the lunch offered on board was good cabin crew were very attentive we arrived in london heathrow terminal approx minutes ahead of schedule however it took my luggage over minutes to arrive overall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage 
1221, dusseldorf to london very satisfied with ba reasonable fares on time awesome cabin staff going to the uk they are my favourite airline in club europe i miss better seating and more leg room as first priority for business 
1222, orlando to gatwick the flight was ok but let down by utterly appalling food the chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour it was mainly just rice the biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar no fruit bits in it just like eating sawdust who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast bizarre and ridiculous looking around the cabin very few were eaten i commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising come on guys even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel what planet are you on 
1223, i really enjoyed my flight from london to johannesburg the aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite in inflight entertainment had a wide selection the food was ok but nothing to get excited about i did eat all of it though as i have grown older i have found long haul flights less tolerable so i was not really looking forward to this flight however i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use british airways on that route again 
1224, chicago to hyderabad via london heathrow all flights left on time but the hyd lhr one arrived an hour late i literally had to run to find my way through heathrow to to board my connection as for the ba flights i found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent served on china plates covered with napkins since i was awake most of the time flight attendants checked multiple times outside of meal hours if they could get me anything my only issue with meals is on the hyd lhr leg lunch was served very late it was almost hours between breakfast lunch that kind of seems their standard practice they serve food sometime after take off and before landing toilets were maintained well in all flights however i wasn t impressed by the seats in ba flights i found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because i also couldn t rest my neck flat down which i could in the aa flight from lhr philadelphia i also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats if they were old or not agile enough the aa flight from lhr philadelphia had bose noise canceling headphones while the ba flights had just regular ones no big deal but still 
1225, san francisco to hyderabad via london i had a really bad experience with british airways i had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try british airways instead of taking my regular emirates the flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take off the customer care was unresponsive i have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times i had to go book emirates in the last moment with hike in price i wrote email to customer care it has taken so much time to get a response from them the bad part is they won t refund your ticket price i hope no one goes through such similar issue my honest opinion be sure of your travel plans before you book british airways i was my first and last journey i wont recommend personally to anyone 
1226, london to duesseldorf on january flew with them times over a one month period this was the last of those flights of the flights were changed or cancelled the flight i was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure mayhem at the t customer service desk far too few people to serve seats on ba are terrible everything costs extra there is nothing good about ba anymore 
1227, i had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life my th birthday on this occasion i had invested in an upgrade and as such i expected nothing less for hours on an overnight flight i had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class i was downgraded as ba overbook their flight by their offer of compensation was i am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class this experience has caused undue stress and at this point i am reluctant to use their services in the future their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming british airways into the world s leading global premium airline our investment in our staff our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service the experience with ba has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday i feel i have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience 
1228, flew london to bengaluru british airways have reached a new low flight boarded on time but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded and engineers were working to replace a pin two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful the ba premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering the promised fine china dining experience only relates to main course all other food and drink was served in plastic the entire meal came on a cluttered tray dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever the chick pea starter was icy cold the main course lamb over cooked tasteless and inedible dessert and cheese portions were minuscule entertainment screen was marbled and very small reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible breakfast service made no pretence to premium service served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery a very unpleasant experience i have no wish to repeat but sadly i have to return to heathrow in the same way 
1229, we flew british airways and ba into out of heathrow late jan seats f h and f h respectively seats were comfortable but the electronic boxes took up some of the legroom food was ok this is coach so no really high expectations plane was clean flight attendants were friendly the ife worked flawlessly good selection of programs bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight we had beverage runs about every hrs if you wanted anything else snacks were available in galley ba did a good job 
1230, reykjavik to london i had to pay to change seats at check in for one checked in baggage you also have to pay for food and beverages on board the aircraft all those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies but now that we know those are traits shared with ba we will also avoid ba in the future 
1231, bangkok to lisbon via heathrow we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july for the travelling date of december one day before our travel we processed the online check in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight bkk lhr without prior notice through any communication channels email sms text by ba after many attempts to find a solution it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand however we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba the airline had removed our names from the entire trip sectors the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the bkk lhr flight if we by ourselves could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets unfortunately there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice to accept the refund to our tickets without offering any other help our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check in online hours before the flight if we had went to check in counter directly on our departure date we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but ba s neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers finally we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve i find it inexcusable for a world class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day holiday of the entire year this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip s spending but left us with one of the worst flying experiences we chose british airways in hopes of a seamless and stress free travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help 
1232, johannesburg to cape town a really basic flight operated by comair no inflight entertainment you had a usb plug to charge your phone they served breakfast it was early in the morning overall a flight with no problems the ground and air staff was good 
1233, london heathrow to paris orly flight arrived mins late nearly double the scheduled flight time as all short haul british airways flights no complimentary food or beverages or included checked baggage premium airline price budget airline service i only use as ba have a virtual monopoly on heathrow and to maintain oneworld status 
1234, flew on ba from london heathrow to belfast city airport january th check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process breakfast offered on board was good and tasty we arrived in belfast minutes ahead of schedule and luggage was out within minutes overall good flight and service 
1235, i was supposed to fly from new york to paris with a direct flight but they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to london the new york to london flight got hours delay therefore we missed our connection in london we waited hours to get the earliest flight from london to paris this flight got also cancelled we rebooked a flight and waited another hours this flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time we finally left the airport and took the eurostar otherwise we could not get home they lost our luggage we received them a week later to our home after hours we got home and complained to british airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but they never answered 
1236, flew singapore to madrid via london heathrow with british airways seat had a broken table and nowhere to move to unless downgraded service was inattentive at best suitcase did not arrive and after repeated attempts to speak to customer service to express the urgency of receiving suitcase for which i had received automated message stating it was at local airport i was told ba does not have the telephone number for office at mad so all that could be done is wait for case to arrive this is beyond ridiculous company used to deliver bag eventually was horrendous they asked to meet them at corner as they could not park when parking was clearly available too many options in business to put up with this low cost service at premium fares 
1237, gatwick to tobago many years since i ve flown in ba club class interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified outbound flight to tobago on january was delayed hours because cleaners hadn t turned up floor around seat not vacuumed properly looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up fa took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker invited over pa system to read high life magazine not in seat pocket had to ask pre flight drinks served ok when asked for meal choice options didn t correspond with what was on menu asked fa if i had wrong menu fa insisted it was right menu looked again and fa said it was wrong menu and brought correct one meal ok fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty seat was comfortable if snug ying yang seat layout makes it hard for fas to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you re in an aisle seat meal tray not horizontal didn t bother to watch movie as screen quality poor flight had caught up a bit on arrival at antigua for stopover but was delayed a further hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator arrived tobago hrs late return overnight flight left tobago on time old school fas on board attentive capable unobtrusive don t think ba trains them like that any more meal tray came with dessert already on it i hadn t selected when converted to bed seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can t bend your legs as i do in sleep got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back seems fairly common for fas on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking if you re obviously awake if they can get you anything not on this flight i guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring club kitchen breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early i can remember when a flight on ba club class was something to look forward to cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service not so any more based on these flights 
1238, no curtains in business class once again british airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they don t matter this flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet why pay more to fly business then dreadful flew in from chicago to heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest i ve ever seen and with awful food the controls in my first class seat did not work either british airways is fast going down the drains avoid 
1239, flew british airways from warsaw to london heathrow my complaint is about the cabin luggage policy my full size cabin bag was given a yellow tag and i had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full if you don t have enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin bags please introduce the wizz air solution the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price or decrease the allowed luggage size the current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair 
1240, i was due to fly london heathrow to vancouver jan th six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled when i called in after waiting for minutes on hold i was told it was due to operational requirements a lot of back and forth but the bottom line ba could not get me back to yvr until thursday i could get a refund on the return portion my flight which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re book or they could fly me into seattle on tuesday and i must make my way home from there on my own dime and i could submit for reimbursement from ba no guarantees they will reimburse though i was told when ba cannot get you to your home destination their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country and forces me to clear customs there and at home i am flying air canada when i return to the uk in february at least if they cancel my flight they will make a better effort to get me back home 
1241, london heathrow to madrid connecting onto iberia to panama city had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for business class flights ba still wanted per person each way to pre book our seats we tried to check in on line and were unable to when we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to costa rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in madrid airport this flight had been booked since march and no one had raised this the assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage we were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to madrid the seats were the same as economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat we were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard we were we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in club world we were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that s just greedy 
1242, london to dusseldorf my suitcase didn t arrive i was unable to file a claim upon arrival because ba was delayed and i had to catch a train to osnabr ck but was told i could file online that is incorrect because the online system doesn t accept american airlines strap tag numbers i tried to call the number i was given but the agents in madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after i explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the dus baggage office i called the local number they gave me but the call was routed every time back to madrid who again refused to take the claim finally on about my third attempt to reason with the agents i found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim however i did not still see my suitcase until four days later now i am trying with difficulty in just getting re mbursed for my modest expenses incurred toiletries underwear doctor s consultation and replacement medication on another topic for a tin of coca cola 
1243, johannesburg to london awful pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant my seat area was absolutely filthy when i asked the stewardess to assist she looked at me like i was such a nuisance made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper between am in the morning i went in search of snacks found the cabin staff in the kitchen area when i asked please may i have some snacks i was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation not one them got up to assist not one of them had replaced any of the snacks the counter was empty only about crisps available and chocs they kept serving the person next to me over me instead of going around me didn t matter that they blocked my viewing that is fine and understandable but no excuse me please can we nothing rudeness at it s best if you asked anything the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore and made one feel like you were being a burden 
1244, london to bangkok i was a bit apprehensive about flying ba club world due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently boarding at heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy on board i offered a pre champagne or water once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts meal pre ordered online i found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked the staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight i know ba club seats are not ideal but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any middle east airline i have flown with entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp cannot see when lights are on in the cabin very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at ba i also must commend ba for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club there rapid response and actions probably saved his life i flew on january well done ba you are pulling in the right direction again 
1245, what i have to say to fly to serve a very well respected motto british airways is always a good choice i was flying business class from lgw to fco everything was excellent the crew were really nice for the whole flight i was travelling solo and i had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food we got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice i got champagne and salmon everything was lly tasty we departed and landed on time with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports and i really appreciate this every time so what to say british airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best european airlines their success is surely deserved 
1246, san jose ca to london heathrow round trip in club world had originally booked in premium economy but received upgrade offers from british airways that were too go to pass up extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided glass of champagne upon boarding premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner cabin crew came by constantly to see how i was doing on both legs lie flat seat gave me hours of sleep on both flights the seat itself was not as wide as i anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue the is a fantastic aircraft comfortable and quiet fast track passes an added plus flying out of san jose is a bonus since i m a ten minute drive to home overall very pleased with british airways and the service provided access to lounges at both airports another plus no complaints from me will look to fly ba again later this year just hope they have more offers for business class 
1247, dubai to london cabin looked dire and wasn t particularly clean seats are dreadful sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle product must be about years out of date food was of poor quality no mid flight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches second meal was tiny arrived at a bus gate in london no bus appeared for about minutes crew blamed the bus providing company overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat 
1248, london to d sseldorf return outbound flight from londiin city was fine boarding was quick and smooth flight was not too busy nice crew on time departure and a breakfast tray which i did not expect on the flight back a to heathrow and you need to buy on board don t understand the concept of ba it s an incosistent product as on the outbound flight there was service on the inbound flight no service they should decide if they are a full service airline or low cost i understand that they are under pressure but they are usually more expensive than lufthansa and a completely different story if compared to easyjet easyjet is not offering any great service but you wouldn t expect it with ba prices are like full service but value for money is much worse than easyjet or eurowings 
1249, new york to london my flight was cancelled on november th the day i was supposed to fly in the evening i received text when i was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that i had to leave in middle after talking to one of the agents for hour and a half i was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from charlotte instead of new york in order to get this new flight i had to be at jfk airport at pm to make this happen i had to skip all last minute arrangements the flight from charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to london our hours flight turned into hours on top of longer and uncomfortable commuting i was unable to sit with my children the meal i requested was not available on the new flight absolute worst experience while flying back from london to new york on november th we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn t have our requested meal available it was my first experience with british airways and i ll make sure it s the last one on my flight back to new york i requested water to one of the attendants and she didn t turn back for minutes i reminded her she said she has been very busy no apology no courtesy nothing a big name like british airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff 
1250, flew british airways from bangkok to aberdeen via heathrow no complaints flight a little delayed on the return leg but all in all was good ba and the rest of the european airlines cant quite keep up with the middle eastern airlines in terms of aircraft emirates etihad etc always seem to have the latest models but the service food check in luggage allowance etc was all good too many people put ba down but thats just the british way we should get behind out national carrier 
1251, flew british airways from rotterdam to london city our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later so that was not a big problem nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew providing a drink and a snack on this min flight inbound flight had a delay of mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point ba needs to improve also check in via ba app didn t work both ways so again there s room for improvement would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check in times and short walkways at rotterdam and london city price can be high though especially when you have checked luggage but we hadn t and i booked well in advance paid euros rtn for two which was fine the advantage of london city is apart from the distance to london that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride 
1252, flew british airways from london to cape town where to start yesterday th january our flight had been rescheduled from for am today due to technical problems which they couldn t fix that night after a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the hilton hotel next door so we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the ba desk to collect our vouchers we duly went along to the hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us by now it was pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained especially those with small children the desk staff told us they were trying to phone ba to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them so at this stage my husband and i decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to london safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for am on the th january we duly left home this morning at am to get here in time for our am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for tonight oh dear ba why couldn t you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night just too efficient for you i guess so we ve been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do no problem ba we didn t mind forking out another to cover it you used to be such a wonderful airline flying our country s colours proudly and we were proud of you it s almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers 
1253, the first class cabins are in need of refurbishment but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish the seats were very comfortable and completely functional entertainment choices were current varied and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety the cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind the food for dinner while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience the breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered overall an extremely pleasant experience there is no wi fi available on this aircraft type 
1254, toronto to london return business to london and first back to toronto all on avios fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team fast track was quick and in the new rd party lounge within mins ba presumably to save money have shut their lounge and gone to a rd party provider premium plaza its frankly awful no class or professionalism with limited wine and spirits options and cheap and nasty food piled high elevator music drove us mad and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft what on earth are you thinking ba fast boarding though with fewer crew the boarding service in club is fragmented late with champagne wash bag after take off etc with only four crew working club there just isn t time to offer a quality pre flight experience the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages we were served drinks minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin had our meal mins after being served drinks all choices were available but the food is just not club standard poor entrees cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of years ago ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge excellent service on boarding a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food all choices available some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea dry sandwiches with mean fillings but okay cakes and scones early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags mins after landing these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences the crew were young and lacking experience knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart however they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service long haul crew were cranky at times but they would connect better and offer a more sleek fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers 
1255, las vegas to manchester via london fairly dire as always ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak before even having rolled it out addicted to cuts perfect partner for aa so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg so why did i not fly a low cost airline there no difference whatsoever the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced and what do you get for food on a transatlantic hour flight to vegas a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes no oil just some grey vinegar it was foul i assume nobody ate it the main was tomato pasta or curry the curry was so appalling i ate none of it the chicken was like paste the sauce dried out and the rice overcooked i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing a mini blueberry muffin was given to my ravenous neighbour no cheese crackers these days nothing served with cold tea i really loved also being rammed on a transfer bus from t to lhr t having waited minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus it won t leave until it is full then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on and to top it all of ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express i have another flight in may which is non refundable i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel they usually do this or times a booking so feeling good this is not a full service airline it is fully no frills the only exception is i think is the long haul canteen meal you get the airline is a national embarrassment the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given but the ground staff are beyond it fly this budget airline at your own peril think about spending a bit more i m going to try lufthansa or thomas cook though i admit i m dreading that prospect 
1256, london to dubai this was a terrible flight with grubby cabins same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying the staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language if ba actually knew their premium passengers they would have avoided this 
1257, amsterdam to london service ryanair wouldn t tolerate but with premium prices every two years or so i fly with ba and every two years i am reminded just why i don t normally fly with them whilst not as bad as my previous experience which chopped about hours off a day break to milan and left me out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived an no they wouldn t refund me we were still delayed all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things ba didn t show the delay until we should have been boarding get to the gate with my shopping what else are you to do during a delay and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they ll put one of my bags in the hold even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no that wasn t allowed once we were on board the reason became clear just like easyjet ryanair and many of the other budget airlines ba doesn t include a checked bag meaning that all the hand luggage won t fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag so not only was the flight delayed but i now had to wait for a suitcase once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly i managed to catch the last train to my destination unlike the previous time i d flown with them additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers do not fly ba save your money and go with a budget airline the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier 
1258, london to johannesburg i was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from lhr jnb i booked this flight as it was a direct flight and although it was around more than emirates and qatar airways it saved around hours off of the journey the a seats were reasonably comfortable and i had plenty of leg room the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies they do need updating though as some were released early lack of onboard wifi is a big letdown too food was standard airline food neither good or bad but ok ba has been taken over for air travel by the big middle eastern airlines but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again long haul only 
1259, will never fly with ba again outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn t have been in service i agree flight home was cancelled by text at pm day before return no assistance provided by ba told it wasn t there problem and sort my own accommodation out took nearly hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight was told club seats weren t available on the only flight with seats departing within days so reluctantly accepted economy seats was told i couldn t have a refund of the difference between club and economy looked at ba site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re booked me onto called back but they refused to put me in the cabin i had paid for saying i had volunteered to downgrade and i would have to pay to upgrade each plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for ba is now as bad as ryanair so will never fly with them again they re charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service 
1260, london to tel aviv i have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of british airways i landed in tel aviv and waited one hour for my bag to appear and when it didn t i went to the qas counter and gave them my information for three days my bag was in london before reaching tel aviv and then the driver didn t bring my bag to where i was staying 
1261, i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british airways having flown premium economy before i had certain expectations of what i would be getting but i was sorely disappointed this was by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and unfortunately also by far the worst the plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment from premium economy i expected wider seats and more legroom the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat where i was constantly pushing against it i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat the personal entertainment system with noise reducing headphones the screen was tiny the blind next to me could not be pulled down the headphones were plugged into the side of the seat where i kept knocking them but the quality was inferior to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in so that i could actually hear anything expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding no priority boarding at all i find it shocking that ba charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs i needed to change my return flight after having tried several times with no success i phoned ba and was on hold for about minutes after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight which worked first time i booked a flight on another airline and for just more i got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant 
1262, hong kong to london before christmas in first class boarding was a little chaotic there was no priority for first class passengers maybe the flight was fully booked cabin crew was very attentive and efficient service was excellent ba does not have the best first class product but their staff is the best in europe food was tasteful and wine selection was superb i had very good hours sleep before landing punctually at lhr looking forward to flying with them again in january 
1263, dublin to heathrow ba gets worse and worse and worse today was special though as usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasn t after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadn t started again as usual club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad today as a special treat they hadn t heated the paninis for my row so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients and finally they ran out of champagne about the only advantage left of club 
1264, london to new york aircraft was very dated ife poor meal service average no snacks poor drinks service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we re outdated a decade ago the meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years to top everything off the crew couldn t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest embarrassing when you tell ba about a negative experience they ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint absolute waste of time don t waste your money flying ba i ve had far more positive experiences on ryanair 
1265, new york to london ife was good and the meal wasn t bad drinks were served throughout the flight before we landed crisps and a chocolate were handed out on the return trip when we arrived at jfk the queues were terrible after we got through the queues the gate staff announced the plane would be delayed by one hour due to a technical fault return flight was enjoyable but the plane was very outdated and ife screens were tiny 
1266, budapest to philadelphia via london they changed my return flight by more than hours when i asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes wonder what they do with the miles the worst business class i have flown never buy their premium class lounge in london is worse than the free lounge an american express card provides what the heck is wrong with them 
1267, london heathrow to hong kong on the a a couple of weeks ago i flew in premium economy which was obtained through points the seats were comfy and felt quite spacious however i am quite a small person glasses of champagne wine offered on arrival and the food was quite good the attendants were polite inflight entertainment was decent i especially liked the festive season section which had a variety of holiday christmas movies plane left and arrived on time having had several negative experiences with british airways in the past i was pleasantly surprised with this flight 
1268, london to montreal very bad service with delayed luggage for some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else s name and to a different destination i was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to dublin first guy i talked on the phone after a week of no news at all he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something in theory he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal but after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing i decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase was still in dublin a second email was sent to get my suitcase send it to me a couple of days after and of course with no news at all from them i decided to call them back again this time my suitcase wasn t in dublin it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport this guy asked me to call them back monday morning london time so i did i called back again on monday morning and after being about minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase when i had done that same day i placed the delayed luggage report don t they have all this info in file after telling him that i did that first day he then asked me to call them back in h again i m tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase no compensation was mentioned to me even that i had to buy clothes and some other items that i already had in my suitcase lucky enough this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable i understand there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that s no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what s yours i think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time i would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me after this awful experience with their missing luggage department i hardly doubt i will use british airways again 
1269, london to houston executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at possible flights per day the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with usd to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end needless to say that because we are away for christmas new year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority because we have been given usd no phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today s flight furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner negated the requirement of giving us usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items 
1270, las vegas to london absolutely horrendous experience we were board and then left to sit on the plane for over hours in high temperatures with no air conditioning the passengers were all sweating before the plane took off kept saying it would be mins and then mins hours odd later we finally took off economy on ba is horrible seats are uncomfortable no space can hardly get refreshments the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water food is bad to make it worse when we landed in london we had to sit on the plane for a further mins because ba didn t have a spare arrivals gate due to all the delays we had to run like mad people to get from heathrow to gatwick in time for our onward flight with ba against all odds we got their with mins to spare plane hadn t boarded yet but they casually said we were too late and said we d have to fly the next day absolute joke i won t be flying with ba again when i have a choice 
1271, flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow overnight flight that departed on time and arrived minutes early to a very easy to navigate through t unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight flight was on board a very old with very poor inflight entertainment b are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated the food was ok the biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested no smiles or even a welcome on board whilst walking down the aisle on arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers the service provided by ba has significantly declined over the past few years even the newer planes b and b haven t got cabins that compete with todays market also just like other budget airlines you now have to pay to choose your seat very very disappointed that i didn t choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price 
1272, i was on a flight from new york jfk budapest via london heathrow on th december the flight was delayed hrs when i arrived to london i got information that my flight to budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow that was on the th december i was there with a few thousends other passengers from ba nobody gave us any food any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase after waiting hrs for my suitcase i was struggling with cold at terminal someon from ba took us to terminal today is th december and i am still in london without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to budapest i paid myself for a hotel and taxi because all other hotels ba offered are fully booked this is not what you normally expect from british national carrier airlines very poor website nothing is working and for days no call centre they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense 
1273, flew tokyo narita to london heathrow with british airways flight delayed by four hours which is understandable due to the weather in the uk at the time the inflight entertainment was awful it was good for only a short haul journey very limited selection and very dated equipment screens plus they kept stalling the staff were ok although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum we were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end the food was average and i was very hungry throughout the service as far as i am aware on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible i don t call being starved very comfortable other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey why can t you you used to be the best and now you re budget i won t be flying with british airways again 
1274, i was quite disappointed with my experience with british airways first of all our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in lhr however the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation however there was no information on connecting flights in lhr once on the plane the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying ryanair or british airways seats were okay but nothing outstanding same with the crew 
1275, flew british airways to pisa due to flight times and ba miles overall a poor economy class product the seats were really tight staff were ok but seemed stressed you had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of ba and they predict other airlines will follow suit difficult to get a glass of water three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child at check in their automated system failed so it was done manually thank goodness for carbon units still employed by ba overall ba is dramatically failing those who have ba miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines ba is no longer uk s national airline the magic of alex cruz and willie walsh is not working if it ever did avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets loyalty does not pay 
1276, london to toulouse british airways is no longer a full service airline to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with m s food this is over priced and not that great secondly the food was never complementary it was included in your ticket price this was the case in this flight to toulouse next time go to pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board i asked for a glass of water this came in the last minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle at least offer people water it is a human right the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for ba s comers charging for food in economy class for long haul flights i hope that this is not true the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good customer care and service has gone avoid ba if you can consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers they are better and more responsive 
1277, great flight out from london to santiago lovely friendly crew goats cheese salad to start fish pie for main good selection of wines and managed hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming back is a fantastic aircraft even if you do have to climb over some feet to get out the window seats are very private flying this aircraft to seychelles in may and really looking forward to it just waiting to try the new bedding now and catering just flown out to kul and ba are way ahead of mh 
1278, london to rome it s been a while since i last flew on ba and it certainly has changed while the terminal staff aircraft and seats are of the same high standards as before the free in flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased it seems that ba is slowly morphing into a low cost carrier at least as far as european destinations are concerned presumably this is due to the competition from easyjet and ryanair as well as it s ceo hailing from vueling i suppose it s only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and ba flies out of lhr 
1279, london to manchester hard to complain about a flight which last mins but i was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection this flight used to include complimentary tea bacon sandwich until the much criticized move to m s inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isn t available anymore all things considered that is understandable 
1280, london to seattle a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about efficient and professional service meal service fine good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra ife selection was perhaps a little limited bags slow to arrive at seattle but don t put that on ba 
1281, seattle to london good experience all round and nothing much to complain about fa s efficient and friendly flight was on time meal quality was average overall believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although i had cashed in some miles to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy major complaint is ba s policy of charging to book a seat it s extremely irritating and stressful especially in premium economy upwards 
1282, london to barcelona the ground service was really poor even thought i used premium counter sapphire status of ow i paid pounds to get exit for myself and my mom however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak english staff could not distinguish the taiwan passport from the china passport and keep said that we need visa to go to spain it took nearly min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad the worst staff i had met although ba sold a very expensive ticket however even a cup of water you have to pay for it i would never choose this airline again 
1283, vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had i was travelling with seniors we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving we actually had to beg for help the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care the seniors had to walk all that way it was not only the walking it was the rush they had as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than hours on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this they said that they called the buggy and that was all we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal to in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal and after security point this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out seats were another problem we did the online check in before and we had the seats already chosen d for one senior isle and d isle for the other senior when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats so once again more walking for them problems to get in out the seats and of course problem to get to the washroom luggage another problem british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver surprise surprise we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage they said we had to pick it up before going through customs there was no way to go back to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage so nightmare again and another rush to us to get to the next fligh according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection what can you expect from british airways if it doesn t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver 
1284, london to berlin tegel return it s becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british airways and the budget airlines the only saving grace is that i ve never experienced any issues flying out of or into t noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a fleet to make space for seats in row and meaning there is only one economy toilet disgraceful my flight to berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn t offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly 
1285, flew london heathrow to dubai arrived at the new wing at t a quick process and into the concorde lounge i noticed as before the check in staff do not mention the concorde lounge per se just straight through there sir and into the st class lounge this option was rammed am pleased to confirm that the concorde lounge has had a long overdue make over it looks a bit better had a snack and a few glasses of fizz then made my way to terminal b friendly fa showed me and wife to our seats looked freshly cleaned pushed back on time st class was full airborne i had dinner mezze to start which was nice some chicken thingy for mains which was horrible cheese and biscuits to conclude wines were ok the seat the new first is not wearing well looking somewhat tired managed to get some sleep on the bed with the usual duvet and blankets i am a tall guy and need the space the club world option is horrendous very pleased to confirm that mr alex cruz bas ceo has re introduced flowers in the st wc readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs if mr cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers s so a full st cabin will generate about of revenue the flowers for wcs probably cost so pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight the st product is very mediocre compared with say emirates some have said its sort of an upmarket business class i d agree with that one would think ba would want to make a big impression on this route with at least some high end food logic is not something ba seem to understand given the high level of negative reviews on this site very disappointing 
1286, flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow arrived at dubai airport checked in and endured horrendous security not bas fault walked miles to the new lounge it s a weird set up you walk through the club option with a considerable variation of food to a tiny room with small options of food seating very mediocre made our way to the plane departed bang on time airbourne i went for lunch straight away after a couple of g ts arabic lamb starter boring and tasteless no other options skipped the soup had a salad the beef mains was very good not exceptional and no wow factor just nice red wine was ok mid priced stuff at about a bottle my wife was told the beef was now unavailable my friend had beef and so did i when challenged on this i was told only beefs aboard this flight was again full and had been for weeks people beefs a joke my wife had an arab dish which she did not like when it came to coffee my friend then i had a choice of chocolates my wife then had the box offered only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy fa most ba cabin staff are good this one was a pr disaster flight was smooth all the way home another sad experience from our national carrier definitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route 
1287, flew british airways from saint lucia to london gatwick agree with other recent reviews ba quality is severely lacking compared to other oneworld carrier s business class we were not addressed by name staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all had to ask for anything we required not all breakfast items were available seat space and comfort seriously under par nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me did not feel like valued customers 
1288, flew from london heathrow to belfast george best airport on ba boarding was well controlled and the breakfast food served onboard was very good i was also impressed by the fast and efficient service arrived in belfast ahead of schedule time overall very good flight and service 
1289, london to miami british airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fast they cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so i had to buy a new flight the compensation they offered was then my most recent trip was to miami which i had an expired esta but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a new flight then offered me a refund when i phoned to complain i am a ba member and must say the customer service is atrocious as a company it s just spiralling down 
1290, flew london heathrow to new york jfk have flown this route a number of times with british airways but this was my first experience with the new club world offerings white company bedding improved catering refurbished club world cabin the new improvements are excellent particularly the catering both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous club world catering offering and the new pick your starter and desert options from the display trolley is a real nice touch the new bedding makes the club world bed much more comfortable to sleep on 
1291, berlin to london city i have never experienced such an unreliable unprofessional airline that is so hard to contact my flight kept being delayed for hours after more than hours delay there was no point for me to fly to london anymore as i had missed an important meeting i was told that i will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation after a few days i call their customer support to ask about the refund they told me that i will get the refund within days after weeks i notice that they still haven t refunded me it s very difficult to contact them the phone hotline is only available until pm monday friday they hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website once i managed to send them a message i only get a reply a few days later telling me that they can t reply to this case via email and that i should call all i want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund i take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times after being on hold for a while it turns out they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next hours a very convenient mistake to forget a refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry only after i asked what compensation i will get for this i was offered avios points no thanks with that level of unreliability and bad customer service i will make sure to never fly british airways again i make sure to tell all my friends about this experience 
1292, flew funchal to london gatwick just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like british airways i left my console on the flight once i realised that i have left it behind i headed over to the help desk which is located in the baggage control area the staff were friendly and happy to assist me the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in hand this has really made me appreciate flying with a high quality airline future flights to madeira are most certainly going to be with british airways 
1293, flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british airways one issue after another the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in london we departed late we should have had a two hour lay over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re routed via washington our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from amsterdam to catch the flight the delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further we eventually arrived in washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour around about trying to find help at the check in desk in a practically empty airport united acting on behalf of ba checked us onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away ironically the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco as business class was full we eventually got to san francisco about hours after our scheduled arrival ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down grade in class they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre booked but unused hotel in san francisco the airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility not a good experience at all and nobody really cares 
1294, manchester to london we were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue then on the flight it was the case of ends of the plane on either side of the curtain those in the front were offered a quick sandwich and a drink those behind had to purchase the short flight was on time the leg room in front of the plane was exactly same as at the rear except the middle seat was blocked off though it felt like business class in the plane on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not ba needs to improve and fast 
1295, london to athens on the date of the flight i received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so i could check in my carry on luggage for free later on another text saying that i will have minute delay i was at the airport almost plus hours before checked in at the machines but it couldn t allocate my seat number then a british airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number seating at a cafe i was checking the tv screen every minutes and it said delay my flight was scheduled for at i tried to pass through security but the machine would allow me to scan my boarding pass and asked me to seek assistance the security officer told me that i lost the flight because my flight was at and suggested me to go to counter c now at the counter c a lady told me that the flight was at and i lost it while i was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made phone calls and tried to explain the whole situation then she told me to go through security because the bar code on my boarding pass will be valid for minutes went straight to my exit and it was packed from people sitting waited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to athens was hr mins 
1296, very disappointing i was scheduled on a british airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at heathrow and having flown ba in the past it was very sad to see how ba service went down this year meal and drinks for purchase uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight i would fly a low cost carrier instead since that s exactly what ba now achieves many years ago it was one of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly ba now it s just another shrinking violet 
1297, this was really a no frills business class this flight was part of trip with qatar airways unfortunately the london to doha was operated by british airways the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay the fas were really dull nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin it might be excellent innovation back in mid s but the industry has moved on 
1298, british airways is seriously lacking in all areas singapore to sydney return in economy fly the route often usually with qantas which are great the flight out to sydney is only hours and over night most people are looking to maximise their sleep especially those who have come from london cabin crew were surly unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised after departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep the food is very average also two hours before landing they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic no tea or coffee the competition is too strong for this route i would never use them again 
1299, london heathrow to basel boarding there are now so many priority boarding passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second class citizens the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further since i was traveling on a low price ticket i found myself seated right at the back of the airplane yes ba appears intent on replicating england s class system on board there was a delay of minutes due to a french atc strike obviously this was not ba s fault but no drinks not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac after take off the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin why ba offer heated sandwiches further slowing down their bob service even further when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place is beyond me the no cash policy further contributes to the snail pace progress of the trolley the trolley and a cup of tea was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes end of service someone at the back quipped so you opted for the premium seats too yes ba is a joke its attitude towards passengers its customers shameless and embarrassing it wasn t until i had left the airport that i was able to get that cup of tea needless to say eurowings and easyjet do things much better 
1300, miami to london heathrow a bit of a mixed bag boarding at miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back so much for safety seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at heathrow also my wife s ife failed mid flight impossible to hear information from the flight deck these ageing s really are in desperate need of replacement the congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable the minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired the only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly 
1301, prague to washington via london british airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg if i want to connect on their one world partner aa which i have exec plat status with ba charges for everything including water prg lhr is on a small business class seat same as in economy dried up breakfast that was tasteless flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon mins before landing and that i should have thought of it earlier london to washington was on a broken down seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips entertainment system has about movies compared to about options on aa flights overall horrible experience the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra tax is ridiculous ba what is it about your flights prg lhr with your onboard luggage allowance only they charge usd for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners horrible food aircraft lhr and transfer experience good luck ba will avoid at all costs included a picture from the bathroom which was broken 
1302, cape town to london i can report a positive experience on our flight from the moment we boarded cabin crew were polite and efficient and provided a high class service throughout seats e f suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy but they are the best for a couple glasses were kept topped up even before take off the menu provided four choices of both starter and mains and all the dishes were both well presented and well cooked talking to cabin crew it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care and this really showed on the flight the ife screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films still no wifi of course take off and landing was on schedule and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism an excellent flight overall 
1303, bangkok to london heathrow despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba has a daylight flight i can t stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can t sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service the fare was also pretty good in the end i have to admit my mates were right this was a let down all along my issues were the following i purchased a ticket in premium economy the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not one of the which operates the lhr bkk lhr route have been refitted the seat date from the early s almost two decades ago and i had to pay pounds each way to select my seat come on yes i got my amenities kit a better pillow british papers and pre departures drinks a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for hr plus but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late s and is a disgrace to the industry great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality i spent hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat the seat itself is way outdated and the cabin seat were dirty it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great the meal service was not good out of bkk bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack just a napkin main dish was ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke no cheese nor crackers not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the j c had a brand new a la carte service as well cabin crew operating both legs were great professional approachable and present in the cabin every mins with drinks out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert the only false note was the meal pre selection you get served first as they do with special meals but do not offer you any drinks you have to wait for a very long time by then my meal was cold and i sent it back they did replace it right away but this was clearly a waste of time pre selecting your meal means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway other than that it was this time a decent meal having said that there was no middle service which meant h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack not acceptable on such a long haul funny enough the bkk lhr feature three meals so why not on the lhr bkk leg ba could be so much better they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right and should have upgraded all their fleet at least years ago it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later 
1304, after hour delay at airport flight destined for verona with arrival time of was rerouted to venice meaning bus transfer and arrival at am we passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change i had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport at such an unsociable hour of the morning i could no longer disturb her i explained all this to ba who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and i would be reimbursed on arrival i was brusquely told by a ba rep to go online and find my own accommodation after a more than hour delay my phone had no battery life i was left to borrow a fellow passenger s phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport miles away from where i should have been it transpires ba knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier i wasted hours at gatwick when i could have carried on working also had i known would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey to top it all when all passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of verona at am no taxis ba had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients further wait not only had i missed my dinner reunion to my astonishment british airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill stating that they had after all got me to my destination i hadn t even counted the extra taxi bills i incurred but i did expect ba to reimburse the hotel as a goodwill gesture not impressed 
1305, flew british airways from madrid to london heathrow an aircraft full of people we were being asked to check in our hand luggage or in some cases to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival i must say i find this irritating as i had one piece of luggage within the rules other people didn t those should be asked to do this i truly felt as if i were in a low cost airline which is sad to see short haul with ba never again 
1306, tel aviv to london we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take the stories were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc there were limited priority options available for first class passengers although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airways the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first and isn t really acceptable if it was just business then it would be fine i guess but there is not very much seating the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another very complicated machine with all instructions only in hebrew at the gate there was the usual priority boarding queue as well as the regular queue but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby members which is a lot of people whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long the service on board didn t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn t happen in first the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing which limits how much you can watch it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch the food and drinks on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special it would have been nice to have been referred to by name which i have had before on ba and with other airlines even in business class on arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in israel i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money 
1307, london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it was pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn t follow the signs properly we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches soup and some dry cake this wasn t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling in terms of seating there was enough for all the passengers in there and it was quite busy and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chairs would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges smiles are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice there aren t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this was an ancient with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution selection and even the fact that some screens won t even stay in place and fold themselves away british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing its age now but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drinks on board were actually quite good although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet overall it was a very enjoyable flight and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money having said that i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash 
1308, kuala lumpur to madrid via london my first time flying ba and i had very low expectations fortunately my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good the service kul lhr was brusque meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight i had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt no and that they couldn t give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer so if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than hours later for the next meal luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats what i didn t like though is that the arm rest couldn t be kept up totally between the seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine the armrest kind of went up to a max of degree angle the seat pockets were very small so there s very little that can kept inside the toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn t work properly they always fall back down and there was never seat liners food was below average 
1309, madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage this resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff every single seat was occupied this was quite hard on the staff a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk based tv personalities this was in english only the inflight service was very poor i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage i regard this as a health and safety matter british airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service 
1310, flew british airways from bologna to london heathrow we arrived at bologna airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us we were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time the member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation for us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the lake district the following day we were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation i thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines 
1311, my husband and i booked our honeymoon to italy through american airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines british airways we ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a minute layover at london heathrow and we would not arrive in rome in the am as planned we decided to give it a shot regardless we arrived at bwi and discovered we were not on an aa flight and had packed more bags than ba would allow we had three checked bags instead of and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to for additional luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge i can t say the same for the rest of our trip we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a hr flight and we had middle seats the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped we arrived into london around am late of course and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until pm we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a pm flight so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner upon our return flights we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web learning from before and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account we eventually had to make an international call and pay to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the hr flight home though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london once we arrived at rome to check we got hit with the additional baggage fee we we tried to explain the representative refused to comp the bag upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for luckily we had the receipt from paying hrs earlier otherwise i imagine we would ve had to shell out again we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey 
1312, flew british airways from london heathrow to johannesburg plane at t satellite c so used b galleries lounge which was quiet and pleasant efficient boarding seats j k on upper deck which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets mixed crew fas and ours were young and enthusiastic in flight service good with a notable improvement in the quality of food i e courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp ife lagging behind that offered by competitors with small screens and limited movies breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual overall a good flight although we look forward to promised improvements in 
1313, london heathrow to brussels i had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in belgium going there the staff at check in in were amazing as i had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price however coming back to london the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging i got on the plane and asked if i could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as i could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation the first staff member at the entrance told me that i had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat if no one could help then he will try to come so that s what i did but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn t allowed to carry a bag unless i help her and even after explaining the situation she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end i work in retail and i know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane i am very angry by this situation and next time i will think twice before choosing the company again 
1314, flew london to san francisco british airways provided a functional disinterested service on this ten hour flight we were given what was necessary and certainly no more ignored for five hours not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the bare minimum and no more if you have to go with british airways do but if you can avoid them then i would in the interest of fairness i have informed the customer service team at british airways of my experience so far i have been ignored hence writing this review 
1315, london heathrow to seoul incheon i was flying my return leg back to korea after a christmas vacation i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return to start with i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault having not had my selection available on the outbound leg in business class i wanted to ensure i had something for my return i couldn t pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of of the available selections quite disgraceful i was also unable to check in on line so i was directed by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in the rest of the airport process after that was smooth this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if i wanted to get out of my chair in flight of course i had to pay extra s for the seat selection in business class a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin the flight was uneventful on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on it s product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class frankly even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier 
1316, seoul incheon to london heathrow this was my first flight on ba for many years as a brit i was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b i was disappointed the fare i paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a j class cabin in my view however it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it i was seated in row by the window my first experience in this cabin was a shock when i realised i was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me and further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row to get into and out from my seat the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service even in row by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non korean clearly something wrong with the meal ratios they offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight i went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise it was mostly just drinks it also seemed to be a fixed meal time something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers the ife selection was nothing more than average i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carriers and i concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin 
1317, flew cape town to london with british airways it s hard to think of a good thing about this flight on the outward journey i was in an aisle seat next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat the crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt so three people suffered cramped conditions for hours the food is awful poor quality and with poor selection of wines cheap spanish wine with no choice the cabin was over heated it was the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken until my return flight entertainment system was not working ancient plane same miserable food this airline used to be good now it is awful 
1318, london to bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of qatar emirates etihad which are far more superior the plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing on this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone it s more akin to economy also a real negative point is your at heathrows newest terminal guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses a shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport this flight is definitely not star and a star rating is where this airline should sit plane was delayed mins arrived mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either ife was poor with old films that they call new releases no where near on a par with qatar airways 
1319, london to philadelphia ticket booked was an amex companion ticket so effectively family of travelled for k in business class return so very good value positives b on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great ife cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful t lounge fine flight on time bags off very quickly negatives food on on both legs wasn t great salad poor and main beef meal very average pudding which is normally the show stopper not great in previous years food been excellent return journey just the same except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful we were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldn t do enough to help the real test of the crew was on landing at lhr we were walking up the jetty and my year old daughter was sick all over me we were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us they were amazing they didn t have to as they were done for the day ba are getting so much stick at the moment their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of k the crew lift this product to a much higher level 
1320, british airways short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum inch pitch with lounge access and a meal thrown in so is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket ba recently introduced business class on domestic routes and as i got a decent price for booking well in advance decided to try it out checking in was efficient and the galleries club lounge adequate no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounges priority boarding although announced did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused having maneuvered into the cramped seat i was offered a hot towel as soon as i sat down i couldn t decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video it was more spot the stars than listen to the safety instructions but i guess it was something different ba was trying out the service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift soon after take off a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight the service was good considering a one hour flight despite a boeing x x layout the cabin felt claustrophobic to me this was no different than economy seating with virtually no leg room how can this be branded as business class is the extra cost justified to fly club europe absolutely not 
1321, i requested asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from oakland to gatwick on the th november but i was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled i was told that on my connection flight i have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at phoenix airport for connection flight which i never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight when i reached phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then i had to go on the different level to check in then down to go through security again to board my flight on my return flight from oakland to gatwick when i went to the check in luggage i was told by the staff at the desk that tsa will break my lock to check through my luggage so please keep it unlocked i requested asian vegetarian food but when i got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet when i mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said that s what you asked for but i said sorry i didn t as on the food label clearly says a and my seat no is k so how is this my food she still didn t believe me instead of apology she said i have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you after mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want i can offer you full english breakfast i said but i am vegetarian she said i don t have any other option 
1322, am continually disappointed by british airways it seems they are now in a race with ryanair and easyjet to become the worst carrier in and out of the uk flew d sseldorf to london their lounge at dus is closed but their check in staff doesn t know that she sent me up there i have a connexion at jfk and i showed her the boarding passes but she wouldn t interline my bag to their partner aa and i had to recheck it now not only do they not serve a second meal on the hour flight lhr lax but now they want for a can of coca cola that they pay p for usually you should always fly across the ocean on a european carrier but with boac i recommend finnair or american with their one world alliance what is the point 
1323, london to santiago cabin crew generally helpful and friendly cabin a bit grubby crumbs nuts and grime in evidence on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant the food was of variable quality as was the coffee none bad some a bit mediocre some good many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another sleeping passenger s legs trying not to wake them up the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can t watch it as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer and that adds to the litter problem after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin what do you do with it er drop it on the floor i did manage to sleep quite well though the pillow you are provided with is very thin on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket sweater or whatever the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer and i don t want to seem a bit picky but although the in flight entertainment has a good choice of films the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating they are all divided into categories such as comedy thrillers etc but no a z all in all it wasn t an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba if they were interested in my advice that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re think the seat configuration 
1324, london to new york jfk in club world after reading very mixed reviews here i also saw that ba were upgrading standards on flights to nyc in particular and was looking forward to my flight should not have been so optimistic as this is still a business class that belongs in the s aircraft was tatty to be polite about it worn carpets seat with various malfunctioning or broken items washrooms grimy from the word go staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins i have flown when i have to pay for the ticket ba talk a lot about their premium standards but even when you pay to dollar for business class the standards are well below even their us counterparts complete rip off sums it up 
1325, my wife and i booked two round trip business class air tickets from johannesburg to victoria falls with british airways comair it turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class they had exactly the same width and pitch actually british airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class moreover our pre flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because british airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in victoria falls yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets rather than which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets 
1326, london to mumbai the electrics at my seat were not working this may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose wires etc the call button light kept coming on and off on its own it was impossible for me to control this and at the time that i did actually want to contact the flight attendant i had to use my husband s remote control to do so because the connection was loose on my remote it meant that things were changing on my tv screen without me being able to control it e g i would press play on the screen then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything because my remote controller was broken it would not return properly into the socket and kept pinging back out this was annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat the tv screen was faulty the usual push and release button did not work i had to push the button and then just try to pull the screen it was very tough even the cabin crew could not release it properly my footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own my husband had to help every time i wanted to move this my husbands footrest was broken the charging socket at my seat did not work so i could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight my husbands charging socket also did not work the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row this is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat row kept opening throughout the flight the attendant would shut it and then it would open this happened during take off and landing as well as throughout the flight for this level of airline and club world seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment this return flight was the first time that i have flown business class we have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our american express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon whilst the outbound flight was great i was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat the hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse once i had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re set after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining hrs of the flight as you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it it was impossible to turn the screen off completely 
1327, i travelled to johannesburg from london heathrow on sunday nd october on flight ba and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on rd october they were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to south africa there was no such requirement on booking the tickets via ba s website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage the requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy s website but well hidden under drop down menus usually when there are requirements like for esta for entry into us ba sends a prompt however there was nothing in this case ba had on its system that i the other parent had travelled ba already reach johannesburg a day before the ba counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband who was travelling with a and year old with any alternative instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets after being given the wrong email address first when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations they refused to refund the ticket cost only refunded taxes of total the overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off putting they said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of gbp k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within hrs of booking other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive even though both my husband and i are frequent travellers and have silver cards of their executive program i will avoid travelling ba even for work after this event have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past 
1328, heathrow to lyon the worst customer service i have ever experienced i arrived at the airport a good hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that i could not check in after a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up i was told i can go on a different flight the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning so i missed a whole day s business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day when i queried the fact that i was unable to board i was told that overselling the flight was normal all airlines do it the fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation i was casually advised to read the small print in the future on the way back from my destination in order to avoid the same thing happening i decided to check in online hours before however i was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by apparently the return flight is overbooked again i do not understand how it is possible that the product service that i have purchased i can not use how can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that i have duly purchased a good months in advance the disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge inept company is beyond pale on top of that the company s decision to no longer serve coffee tea and food on board is unacceptable the ba has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium prices i certainly will never travel the ba ever again 
1329, absolutely appalling service from ba i booked seats with extra leg room with a ba representative to ensure i was getting the seats we needed on arrival at the aircraft we did not have those seats our return flight was the same so i applied for a refund after a lot of back and forth with ba they started paying it back in drips and drabs not the full amount so far i have received half of the amount owed i traveled months ago i have called a dozen times emailed and filled out forms and the last i heard was that someone would contact me and would sort this matter out no one has called back in months now when i call they say you can t chase anymore you have to await for someone to call you ba you are a disgrace i have been patient and you have done nothing worst airline i have ever had to deal with 
1330, kingston to london gatwick it was my first time flying with british airways and to be very honest it is my last time ever flying with them i had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming back from my destination 
1331, heathrow to barcelona reliable no longer feels like travelling with a premium airline very functional but unfortunately at a cost flight took off late because luggage for a passenger needed to be off loaded however arrived on time in barcelona excellent information from the flight deck cabin crew robotic and lacked personality enough has already been said about charges for food and drink overall falling well below the standards of the competition great pity really 
1332, singapore to london my feedback seems to mirror many other users here ba standards are just getting worse and worse and i am talking about business class which i thought they would maintain the cabin interior was worn and quite grubby the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class the meal and presentation is really a joke and on my previous long haul biz trip i got better food in lufthansa premium economy cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting ba because of the fall in standards i m not surprised and i for one would not use them again for long haul time for senior management changes as the present ceo clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline now they do little more than a low cost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in europe 
1333, british airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game the service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced the quality of the food served had lifted materially the staff were helpful the big downside is that club europe sets remains stock standard economy seats with the middle seat blocked off the pitch is tight too tight in my view another couple of centimetres would be welcome overall a better ba experience 
1334, heathrow to dubai this is a warning of what to expect from british airways if they continue to treat passengers this way i can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty the reply i got from the airline below just brushed all the issues i raised under the carpet living in egypt for years i became i frequent flyer with egyptair if i wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me ba want to charge me over and because i wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a refund even though i would have given them over months notice this airline is on my black list makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline but never again will i book another flight with ba there was no priority seat booking unless i paid another extra there was no priority boarding i booked seat d but this was mysteriously changed at check in to e ba emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was i did not make any changes in premium economy i was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room is this some kind of joke i had to double check that i wasn t in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row the tough chicken meal was diabolical the cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever i really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway i ended up paying extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight a few days previously i flew premium economy with virgin atlantic return from barbados and the difference between ba and virgin is worlds apart 
1335, flew british airways from tokyo haneda to london heathrow this is one of the worst flights i have ever had the seats were so weak that i felt every movement of the passangers around me especially the guy in front really old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet food was also horrible 
1336, london to toronto by now it is nothing new anymore that the ceos very aggressive cost cutting affected all classes including first business which called club world does not deserve it name because it is simply appalling again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder because there are smaller teams it is not surprising that ba current ranking bounced back to th from th in fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended once a grand airline today just another star airline like there are so many 
1337, new york to london heathrow first class check in at t in jfk was quick polite staff provide better service than those at heathrow the concorde room is just a few metres after security it is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths but washroom shower facilities are downmarket selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty boarding was reasonably efficient and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks pyjamas etc delay of about mins on departure was made up during the flight i opted to sleep straight after take off seat comfort is okay if a little narrow minutes before arrival i had some fruits and pastry for breakfast accompanied by some good coffee while i only needed minimal service onboard the staff were courteous and efficient and they are one of very few good things left after ba after their ceo seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of years arrival into t at heathrow b satellite at was absolute bedlam and a reason i would choose another airline on this route we wanted for satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main terminal to find immigration in total disorganised chaos i buy and pay for my own tickets and do feel that ba is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provide please get a ceo that values quality over bean counting 
1338, gatwick to marrakech the cabin crew was lazy and rude refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than seconds for the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu the lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers after minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadn t finished serving other customers even though none of the staff members was seen serving anyone we waited minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored after another minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving we tried for over hour to buy some jaffa cakes which would have taken less than seconds but it was too much to ask for ryanair or easyjet service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew i will not use ba again if i can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline 
1339, this was my first time flying with british airways from los angeles to london heathrow i was able to secure a window seat for myself without paying any fee during online check in hours prior to departure the baggage drop off experience at lax and lhr was smooth at lax the ba staff tags your check in bags at lhr you have to do it yourself the on board experience was good this was my first time sitting on the upper deck of a which had a special storage bin by the window armrest food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights chicken or pasta there was no wifi but ba had a good collection of movies i enjoyed ba s in flight movie snack as well the flight map tracker wasn t working on one segment which was a bit surprising overall i had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with ba again 
1340, gatwick to cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair the website was easy to use and very clear i checked in online and simply had to drop off my bag i arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already the boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean my seat was comfortable for a short flight the captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew i could see worked very hard and were pleasant the crew made use of italian and were cheerful and professional my gripe is the awful use of marks and spencer food this has to be purchased and a good few items were not available there were no route maps and no entertainment systems the lavatory was clean disembarkation was managed well 
1341, shanghai to tampa via heathrow gatwick we received deplorable customer service recently from british airways i purchased business class tickets on for flights on september i purchased two tickets for a total of plus an additional for seat assignments the problems occurred on our return flights we were booked october on ba shanghai to lhr london with continuing service october from london gatwick to tampa we were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october we checked in online hours before our flights scheduled departure at a m on the evening of october the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at a m in the morning on october the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our am flight we were unable to do so we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country we were aware of this requirement we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane we knew that without a visa of valid flights out we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation we were able to contact a travel agent via e mail our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation there was another flight that departed on october which was hours minutes after our original flight that was flt ba we were told here are your choices pay a change fee of and be down graded to premium economy on both flights ba and ba even though we would be able to make ba as it did not depart london lgw until am on october pay an additional per person for a total of to keep our business class status on both flights we had already paid for these tickets disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration option was outrageous option frightening we felt we had no choice but to choose option the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check in and request our business class seats if they were available when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available yes several was the response we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats yes for a cost of of course we refused to pay that amount we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class two suitcases were over the lbs limit for economy while on board during that flight ba i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats were we on the same flight as originally scheduled but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense 
1342, gatwick to marrakech generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class my gripe is about the current food service this was a fairly long short haul flight scheduled for h m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho ice on board is very limited especially as much seems to be already sold out the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about of passengers bought nothing of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of hr from dublin to london if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it 
1343, oakland to heathrow and this flight was fine the worst that could be said is that there is no magic that other airlines manage to provide left and arrived on time fa attentive and professional food reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportions my only real complaint was the inflight entertainment was rather poor with lots of old films and tv programmes and a mediocre choice of music 
1344, london to sofia cabin crew were kind this is the only positive thing british airways are now becoming as bad as ryanair onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water when i booked my flight from heathrow to sofia i was told i get a free checked in bag for my baby girl a day before my flight i decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me i need to pay for checked in bag if i want one i told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true i asked him to double check this and he said he already did so i had to pay for a checked bag each way since i already had my suitcase packed next day as i went to the check in at heathrow i was asked how many bags do i want to check in i asked how many bags am i allowed to check in and the lady said i can check in two bags one for my baby and the one that i ve paid for the previous day the thing is that i only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me i can only check one bag if i pay for it first after i arrived in sofia i rang british airways and explained everything so they agreed they should refund the money they ve charged me for the additional bag they said they ll refund the for the london sofia flight the same day and the other fee for the sofia london route in about a week time a month later i checked my online banking and saw they ve only refunded for the outbound journey i rang them and they ve said they are sorry and they ll refund the remaining within the next days when i pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that i get a discount voucher from my next flight price they said this is something british airways do not offer 
1345, singapore to nassau via heathrow british airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with i will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from heathrow to singapore on oct there were bugs on the flight and i have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places one can suffer the bad food service behavior of cabin staff but having one s health compromised is unacceptable the toilets were filthy i was in the paid premium seat front row and i could smell the toilet from there the attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason the food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available while flying from nassau to heathrow the dinner was fine but the breakfast i think it was a morning snack consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar i mean you cant get a croissant right the inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired the screens in the singapore heathrow sectors were ok to use but the heathrow to nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time i could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the touch screen more like punch screen the flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time it could learn well from airlines like singapore airlines which are pretty consistent and clean i am giving the airline of only for value for money 
1346, flew london heathrow to madrid british airways monopoly of the routes to spain have a serious impact on the quality ba owns iberia so there s no competition planes are the worst of the ba fleet check in is a nightmare because they operate each other s flight but the online check in does not recognize each other s booking references really the worst of ba and iberia worlds together 
1347, london to zurich a budget airline at premium prices lots of late and cancelled flights pay for luggage food and drinks poor customer services even at silver level i have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport no assistance for transport 
1348, bari to gatwick more of the same all held together by cockpit crew follows my review of the outbound leg a week back check in excellent not ba staff and security at bari a breeze boarding well organised cabin crew chatting to each other as i boarded and ignored me this is inexcusable flight fine ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit didn t buy anything this time smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience gatwick south unpleasant tho not ba s fault endless staircases broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e gates were out of action baggage hadn t arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant had an offer to upgrade to club for a joke as there is no lounge at bari and the onboard value is a max of i do still like flying ba as much as i don t easy or ryanair but sinking to their levels will put ba out of business for short haul there is now little differentiator 
1349, early morning flight london heathrow to gibraltar now i know that british airways have started charging for food and drink on european flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than ryanair or easyjet it might be m s food but if you can t get any that does not help we were seated at the rear of the cabin since ba started to charge i have noticed that there is only food cart which started at the front before there would have been with at the front and at the rear now by the time the cart get to you it is hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things this flight was early morning and they had bacon rolls on the menu which were going to be their best seller and it sells out pros kgs cabin bag allow best in the business 
1350, pisa to gatwick i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany believe me it does not get any better but the option is ryanair and that s worse flight started in the new south terminal lounge the decor and layout of the facility is great no problems here although it s located in a not so easy place to find breakfast food was ghastly cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up eggy thing horrible didn t touch it and those that did left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a g t yes i know bit early in the day short walk to the gate plane left on time the usual horrible for seats in club europe the front row made it easier but only just had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad the plane was very old this was confirmed by the wc originally the loo flush button was blue after uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses to a grey colour the loo basin cannot be described here plane landed on time the captain came out and i had a nice chat with him very nice bloke return flight started in the shared lounge it okay but can get busy same plane back recognizable by the flush button in the loo unless all the ba s are like it skipped the meal as i d eaten lunch in pisa it looked nice though a few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product club europe is great flight back into the setting sun fas on all flights were great morale very low thanks to the miserable mean cost cutting by the ba ceo mr cruz who has no idea on how to run an airline i first flew ba in and what a difference decline is sad and depressing to see as verified by of reviews here be so negative time to find a new ceo i think 
1351, las vegas to london heathrow this particular boeing must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert the condition of this aircraft was appalling the first class cabin was literally falling apart with loose yellowed bins and filthy carpets the entertainment system was old and slow and low definition the premium economy cabin was directly behind first class and those passengers kept using the first class toilets it didn t matter because they were filthy the dinner in first class was inedible british airways are now a national embarrassment british airways are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors 
1352, london city to edinburgh flight left on time and arrived early impressed with the legroom on the embraer much more comfortable than ba s a s check in security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly cabin crew were efficient light snack and drink provided on this short flight would fly with ba again on short sectors and lcy is an excellent airport to use 
1353, faro to gatwick check in was quiet at the club europe desk and i was very quickly booked in fast track security at the airport wasn t particularly well managed although i did get through quicker than i would have otherwise disappointingly british airways do not provide any lounge access at faro and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise there was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual british airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself the aircraft was the new style which i think is very smart and nicely decorated not budget airline as some commentators like to say and whilst the legroom isn t amazing i am tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space the cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient a bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight all of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg that being said it tasted very nice arriving into gatwick was a dream especially for a large airport although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick it took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless i got a good deal on the flight so i would say it was reasonably good value for money although the experience in faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably 
1354, los angeles to london heathrow the inflight entertainment was not working so no tv video music or radio usb socket not working headphones not working customer service very poor cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend food mediocre there was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn t bother to fetch any tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed no refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley it took days to get through to customer relations many calls cutting off after minutes others cancelled after going through options i cannot recommend british airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve the experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service as the british flag carrier the experience was shameful my last flight with this airline 
1355, malaga to gatwick they ve introduced new cabin baggage allowances ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers resulting in a ryanair like scuffle they now charge for food this would be fine if it didn t take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane on my previous three flights with the new ba we ve been left for over an hour and a half the last flight was actually over two hours without any service as the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane on the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off the cabin crew seem genuinely fed up one of the key reasons for flying ba was their friendly cabin crew service this has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company giving them no time or energy by the look of it to be nice ultimately if price is everything make sure you check norwegian before you spend any money with ba if price isn t everything don t fly ba 
1356, london heathrow to bangkok was looking forward to eventually flying with british airways after flying reguarly to bangkok with other airlines how disappointed i was a low budget product with a premium price i will never again use this airline its the most costly option usually for my regular journey to thailand but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines i ve used on this route in past trips seatback screen so small and of poor quality service is dreadful seats are old with no powerpoints no wifi on board best part of the trip was getting off absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the uk lower your costs ba as you really are budget go fly with any of the gulf airlines or a vast majority of europe s best ba are nowhere near good enough current price almost a rd more than the other direct flights eva and thai to bangkok and british airways is only half as good as those 
1357, gatwick to bari employees who do not care for passengers queued at club bag drop only desks open one busy one with two staff talking one with staff looking at screen barely greeted when it was my turn just asked if i d checked in on line cursory greeting at lounge ignored by cabin attendant on boarding he pushed past me to talk to ground staff good on time flight with usual impeccable pilot bought a coffee dreadful apparently artisan coffee almost no eye contact with cabin crew flight was a good price 
1358, malaga to gatwick our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant check in at malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet sunday vip lounge at malaga used by ba and other airlines apparently its the only one there is pretty useless compared with the old ba lounge that used to be there cost cutting guess we were spoiled by gatwick drink okay but limited food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due i guess to help from hurricane ophelia which i guess we were on the fringe of in board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew chatted to the first officer nice man all in all we were well looked after in this class so can t complain 
1359, gatwick to malaga first flight with ba from new home at south terminal at london gatwick upon arrival at check in at a m was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with business class passengers resulting in a minute wait to sort out our bags however fast track through customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation new lounge in south terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality although sadly the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks a to malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality we arrived mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain overall flight quality has to be excellent 
1360, london heathrow to nice deliberate extortion by ba in my opinion i booked an economy basic return from nice to london with ba days before the outbound i had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier i ended up buying a new single outbound flight as ba app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight in the uk i received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from ba however app again gave up and said i had logged in too many times upon arrival at heathrow i was told ba had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings they said i had to pay approx to buy a new single ticket home even after i explained my situation i argued that had i been informed that they had cancelled my flight days ago when they did i could have at least bought a cheaper flight even the day before when i got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for charging me again for taxes as i needed to get back and there was no time to go to gatwick for cheaper flight i had no choice but to pay terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when i asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t c he said he would not like to comment 
1361, gatwick to orlando return worst ever long haul business class flight we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended not the world s favourite airline by far we have never liked ba s business class club world seats since they changed over to the yin yang layout of seats across the cabin the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long haul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks meals which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor this aircraft was delivered to ba in march and it shows its age this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that does not make it right we will probably never fly ba long haul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re configure their seating 
1362, london to abu dhabi i told ba at check in that i would be interested in upgrading to premium economy if a window seat was available the lady replied can i check you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window i replied yes after a series of phone calls the upgrade was processed i paid gbp my seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of premium economy where the toilets should be when i complained i was told that seats could not be guaranteed so i had no complaint no refund offered no token gesture offered nothing the food was nice and the seat was very comfortable if it wasn t for the rude customer service i would fly again i was led to believe i could pay for a window seat and i paid in good faith i ve flown ba for years but this year has been disappointing i won t fly with them again 
1363, gatwick to faro pretty good flight all round and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well it worked out good value check in area at south terminal is very nice and i was checked in very quickly with fast track security equally quick the new ba lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac it was early morning and breakfast was served which was reasonably good although the hot options were just bacon roll omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited staff were all excellent boarding was quick cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered this was an older aircraft with the old style seating but the aircraft was clean and didn t show much sign of age the seats are comfortable enough although legroom is not amazing i was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most the cooked breakfast was actually fairly good i think nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients disembarkation was quick enough although bags took quite a while priority baggage didn t seem to count for a lot and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags overall a good flight 
1364, london to madrid in economy class late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay boarding quite efficient cabin was dirty carpets table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy i wouldn t have minded on a cheap ticket but this was not a true case of rip off ba in will avoid if possible 
1365, i was told on the saturday that my hand luggage was fine the right size by ba staff at geneva airport it was physically inspected then on monday i was ordered to pay francs staff at the airport were insanely rude to be honest the supervisor particularly their customer service is also awful it s a joke of an airline compared to competitors like qatar when filing a complaint they did not respond for weeks they only responded when i chased them up said waiting time is actually weeks can you believe that the explanation was their it system failed in may an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved 
1366, grand cayman to london i can t comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about hours of travel across the atlantic ocean only allows check in free bag for economy class upon returning to gcm from lon on october i had to pay for additional baggage particularly for university students such as myself who migrate from such distances to achieve good education in addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage has ba gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush toothpaste eye mask for hour flights that was one of the things i appreciated most about ba as it made me feel valued i am truly disappointed with ba these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to lon from gcm you guarantee i will abandon ba 
1367, sydney to paris via london after flying with them i have to admit it s probably the worst airline i have been flying when i boarded the plane i notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my i assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep ear plugs maybe a small tube of toothpaste here you have some headphones and that s all with british airways you can order some special meals i received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast one of the cabin crew asked me if i ordered a special meal the plane looked quite old i tried ba never again 
1368, larnaca to london heathrow the return trip from our holiday bas product was more like a posh ryanair style of product even down to the asking for donations towards their charity there were a few noticeable differences on the aircraft there was in flight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the tv screen on ryanair easyjet and other low cost airlines you can pay using cash but no on ba it is card payment only in sterling the aircraft was clean and tidy but overall the main ba product has gone downhill and the service standards have slipped comparing this flight to my recent flights from london city with ba cityflyer there is a vast standard in the cabin service standards 
1369, funchal to gatwick due to adverse weather our return flight was delayed three days when we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight the catering service was absymal no choice of hot meal hardly a bar service and no tea coffee i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw they hadn t fully loaded the food drinks trolleys in contrast to the outgoing flight this was a flight to be endured just shows what a difference the crew can make 
1370, orlando to gatwick the staff that looked after us flying out to florida and home were outstanding on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children i was really worried about flying home away from my children i spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do the seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep the only thing we weren t to happy with was the movies but i guess you can t have everything all in all i would book to fly with ba again and would highly recommend 
1371, flew leeds bradford to geneva via london heathrow british airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style my bag was kg kg over the limit this meant i had to pay for two bags whilst only having one when i asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra or so the answer was no which was odd considering the bag was on the belt right infront of me on board the aircraft boarding was prompt a clean sleek cabin i was seated near the back close to the toilet which wasn t a problem beverage service was okay everything was over priced i bought a ginger ale for and it was a cup which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can the only thing that was free on board was water for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing the crew were friendly and helpful but i couldn t help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into switzerland what they were talking about was inappropriate especially how loud they were talking with children nearby apart from those things the flight was on time punctual and served the purpose which i paid for 
1372, los angeles to doha via london great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout i m spoilt flying gulf airlines but this time i tried a rear facing internal of configuration firstly staring in the face of my two new best friends seats facing forward was at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience crew could barely serve me ventilation was restricted and access blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers once the security screens went up i felt like i was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression i had died and was on a viewing the food was embarrassing bad bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls ba you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support 
1373, london heathrow to istanbul british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers even loyal ones who have status like myself the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline galleries south in t is large airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table seating is cramped the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyjet in fact i would argue worse there is no complimentary catering you are subjected to m s sandwiches it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings service is slow and took the whole of hours of the flight meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people the slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier doesn t allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down on the return journey its clear ba doesn t care about its european or non north american routes the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food was decent overall if it wasn t for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed 
1374, toronto to london in premium economy and onto oslo in economy easy check in and in the lounge within mins the usual selection of dry sandwiches and a chicken noodle soup minus the chicken and noodle the lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away efficient boarding with sparking wine soft drinks offered early departure fast drink service and dinner before lights out there was no breakfast previously scrapped with the cereal bar now also gone early arrival a short wait for a shower in the north lounge followed by an ok breakfast an early departure and an average flight on a a long queues for the bathroom only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide more seats with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink early arrival though a long wait for bags oslo to london on a a was verging on a farce a full flight selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space the buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life broke out the paper visa slips took the cart back in re appeared mins later so service started an hour into the flight little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases the crew tried really hard put a brave face on and kept going the organisation and concept of the ba buy on board is a disgrace though a third party provides the food and card machines the choice stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce i don t understand why ba continue to struggle with this service as easyjet ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together early arrival and fast bags completed the flight final flight home to toronto was good the club lounge at the b gates remains quiet clean and an oasis to relax and eat drink before flying the was towed to the gate mins before departure and was never going to leave on time at the gate the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class service was really slow on boarding i had to ask for champagne and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off we pushed back over late no signs of life from crew for another mins though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart the main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking no dried gravy or potato around the edges afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic overall the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements the crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience the desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times other than the farce of buy on board i was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service 
1375, my early morning flight from gatwick to malaga was a very pleasant experience overall the flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crew announcements were clear and friendly however there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the marks and spencer to buy menu were not available at all i must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting 
1376, athens to london slowest baggage drop service i have ever experienced i spent a whole hour waiting to drop my bag queue for people who have already checked in i seriously do not understand how they can be so slow people have already checked in they just need to leave a bag the company really needs to look after their processes
1377, a return british airways flight from london to sofia was a service of halves the outboard leg was very good from london to bulgaria the check in was swift and efficient boarding the flight was simple and quick the bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick disembarking off the plane was straight forward and easy the flight was worth a good out of the return flight from sofia to london was the opposite check in was slow and not inefficient there was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a ryanair type of scramble to board the plane the bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag a rucksack and then a small holdall the cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take off once airborne the m s service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served with only drinks and crisps available towards the end finally disembarking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their bags while holding up the isle overall i would give this leg out of 
1378, geneva to london british airways used to be my favourite airline however over the last years i have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights i have had with them i do fly with ba about times a year in this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure arrival cities i was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind i was flying at am the morning after their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight i must have call that number about times without success as the lines were too busy when i managed to connect i have had to hold for an hour before the line died i have only managed to speak to them at pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight hours later horrible customer service by the way the person i was talking to couldn t care less i was originally flying in business and i was placed in economy instead i was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries and promised a refund on the fare which to date about months later has still not happened if you call them they transfer your call to india where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help what once was the best airline is now worse than ryanair avoid if possible
1379, ba used to be a nice airline with great customer service those days are long gone if you fly in their business class you will get what you used to get in economy years ago same leg space same food same drinks forget about a welcome drink before take off course dinner was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight and personalized service economy class is just like easyjet or ryanair but you will pay much less for the latter ones shame 
1380, london heathrow to new york after reading reviews i was hoping some were inaccurate but after this flight in club world i realise that ba has fallen even lower than many have said check in at t was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff i have encountered for years the lounge was crowded and dirty and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility onboard seats are old and tatty cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever the food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me and what a lousy offering this was below many airline economy meal standards ife screen was not working properly fuzzy and very poor cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these luckily i am leaving the usa to asia from los angeles next week on eva air and expecting a big step up in standards 
1381, port of spain to gatwick via st lucia was a good experience i don t have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks the seat was comfortable enough a bit wider than on low cost flights i had extra space and as i noticed the leg room between seats was regular i had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room there was a minor issue the flight had a stop at st lucia after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row opened their entertainment system screens to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from port of spain i told them it s not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time so this would be something the management should look into in flight entertainment was good with no advertising which pleased me a lot i had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat sometimes talked louder than necessary but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers there were minor issues during check in at the departure airport in port of spain the ba staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as i have a gold card on oneworld to use the lounge i had to use my priority pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff i was flying further from gatwick to istanbul on turkish airlines hoping i would not have to change airports in london and as a result go through immigration take the baggage out check in again pass immigration and security again but ba doesn t have an agreement with turkish airlines and i had to go through this lengthy process 
1382, flew london heathrow to chicago simply appalling aircraft was old configuration b with premium economy adjacent to first class cabin was filthy and carpets coming up food was inedible the ife system was old slow and low resolution no wireless of course either british airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service and sample it themselves for them to call it first class is insulting demeaning and arrogant in the extreme these old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely a and the entire first class and club class product should be reviewed enhanced but of course this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the atlantic 
1383, jersey to gatwick flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern the crew were friendly the flight was only minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but i m not sure they made it to the final rows i think the problem is that there are only staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our easyjet flight out there had been staff as there is no business class i still don t think the buy on board is working that well but that is not the crew s fault we were pleased to arrive minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal the ba offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy 
1384, gatwick to tirana full flight on both outward and return journey the seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch the aircraft was clean cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods the main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from uk to tirana otherwise nothing special to recommend both flights on time 
1385, i booked british airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier i expected a meal and baggage to be included i was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after i booked this airline is no longer quality with the prices they charge expect a budget airline experience here staff were very friendly and helpful however pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info 
1386, kuala lumpur to berlin via london aircraft long haul new and clean short haul a bit old but still acceptable crew overall are lovely pleasant service ba food is on the top of the rank kuala lumpur to london my boyfriend and i got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast also very tasty we got wines and so many juices return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta again it flavorful and we got beef congee and engliah breakfast before we landed short hauls don t have any food inflight entertainment not the best but still acceptable short hauls don t have any screens only thing i don t like is the seats economy seats are small i have no problem with it since i am a petite girl but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up if i knew before i will book a premium economy that one seems nicer and have more space i got the best price for round trip value for money 
1387, i flew from brussels to london heathrow on an a the aircraft was about three quarters full boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early the sale of food and drinks went well and didn t appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour crew were good 
1388, i flew from london heathrow to sofia and back the plane on both flights was an airbus and i d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior i am m feet tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine i certainly didn t feel cramped even in the centre seat both flights departed the gate on schedule although actual take off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over europe the cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous on both flights the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress so far top marks to british airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it which you do not on other legacy airlines like lufthansa the range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines i have flown with but there the comparison ends because whilst i have always been served quickly and sometimes twice on short haul low cost airlines ba s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too they also insist on card only transactions i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs and the a is a long plane a single trolley started from the front making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long i only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories the coffee by the way was excellent the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley leaving the remaining passengers unserved in conclusion clean plane punctual service pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service 
1389, heathrow to bilbao boarding of the flight at heathrow was very good the flight was on time and the plane was clean frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed from then on the service was very similar to a easy jet or eurowings flight the crew member s in economy passed through the cabin selling m s sandwiches snacks and coffee the flight out of bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent however the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed the flight crew also managed to shave minutes off the flight time too however the service onboard is similar to eurowings both flights were safe and competent but the actual flight experience was lacking and in future i will consider easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money 
1390, kalamata to london heathrow no priority boarding at kalamata drink and food service poorly synchronised with no pre dinner drink no nuts and bread served with main course lacto ovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu the special main was yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish overall a pathetic vegetarian offering cabin crew did the bare minimum in club europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the m s stuff in economy which they were doing up until minutes from landing the club europe toilet was grubby flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for baggage at t 
1391, london heathrow to krakow i am a one world emerald member on aa so i get certain perks when flying british airways such as free seat selection lounge use and priority boarding that makes this airline bearable just they are obsessed with carry on bags much like ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight what used to set ba apart was their inflight service even in coach a sandwich or something this has degraded to nothing zero even a soft drink is charged so i asked for water i was offered an evian for no thanks just plain water ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else of course he never came back hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water ba are listed as a star airline aa are a star yet aa now have better inflight service than ba by a country mile ba are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier 
1392, london heathrow to abuja nigeria with british airways departed on time paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door don t bother as it has no pocket for documents glasses etc seat so narrow that you cannot move seat cushion hard and old cabin crew comment you have extra legroom arent you lucky my comment yes and i paid for it when i asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport food was bland arrived on time departing abuja on return trip i had an aisle seat again narrow and extremely uncomfortable old aircraft cost cutting squeeze in economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet food on return trip was a so called breakfast yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear return flight was on time punctuality was bas saving grace 
1393, london to tokyo haneda boeing was tatty inside cabin items seats carpets tables etc worn and dirty sticky surfaces and hate to think what germs are being stored here meal standards are very poor compared to lufthansa and ana that i flew earlier this year reflects the ba move to being budget standard airline at premium prices cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at ba time to remove the low cost airline minded ceo there now and surely skytrax must now downgrade them to stars at best 
1394, london heathrow to hong kong a really mixed experience in the positive side cabin crew were professional and polite cockpit announcements very informative flight on time with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure in terms of hard product i was a bit disappointed the premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight entertainment screen very slow to respond happened to me to with another a from ba so means it s an issue with the hardware food is decent quality but the presentation at least in pe could be improved the luggage delivery has been a pain minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much even for such a big airplane 
1395, gatwick to alicante yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby the language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible it was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlines previously we had had a lot of respect for british airways standards now thoroughly destroyed 
1396, flew london heathrow to kalamata slow boarding on this new ba destination in greece club europe seats uncomfortable for a hour flight particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service no ife cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout lunch service definitely improved although the lacto ovo vegetarian main course was the usual bland overcooked pasta arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing overall a reasonable flight although club europe is poor value by competitors business class standards 
1397, gatwick to mauritius very disappointing airline and service the facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits it s a mess why because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid flight or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid sleep every time they need to use the restroom the tv monitors colors are so off it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie getting the brightness right to make the colors work because if you don t want the monitor to blind you when it s snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red the worst thing was the food salad was frozen the beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty my partner s chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it was hitting all the wrong spots they believe in umami and dump a ton of msgs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong i ended up eating bread and butter only same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast bacon was extra salty and the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad overall very poor and disappointing experience 
1398, dubai to london i am a regular ba flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a tier airline the journey started in the concorde lounge dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours i was there was not refreshed onboard the you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule amazingly when the menu came it contained only an arabic snack with no options they say this is to allow maximum sleep no other airline has done this breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible it is incredible that you can spend usd on a ticket and you can t even get a meal the airline is clearly failing fast and i wish now i had flown the luxury of emirates at half the price very disappointing and they don t care 
1399, london heathrow to biarritz had a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crew first time to experience a ml bottle of champagne on the drinks trolley which was chilled for me terminal is a nice place to start any trip and would choose ba for my next holiday 
1400, london gatwick to funchal in my opinion british airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom for travellers in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that they have failed to understand what their true market is all about generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it s expensive frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay and that assumes that from the enormous range of types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than hours to make it from the front to the back service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink maybe that s in the next part of the ba master plan british airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away don t ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for free food and drink sadly i think we know the answer all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete 
1401, zakinthos to london heathrow poor check in at zante airport not enough desks slightly clueless staff mrs b had to deploy laser beams to get front row which was free slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding after that very good flight again much busier club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentive beetroot carpaccio with goats cheese melt in mouth ox cheek poor desert again again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co pilot coming out to chat not left wanting the whole flight a bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will this kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues one pays more for more toilets kids in dire need ok adults no time made up almost t quite quick again so another good experience for us with ba cheers 
1402, flew british airways from belfast city to london heathrow first time i flew from belfast and it s a great little airport i had access to the ba lounge which for such a small airport is pretty good it was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including chicken smoked salmon egg etc the bar was well stocked including fever tree tonic and grey goose vodka champagne was available on request due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge but at gate but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal the flight was probably at capacity so the fa had no problems serving passengers the flight was delayed by minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at heathrow minutes late this was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at return but as a gold member i got most of the business class benefits 
1403, toronto to london heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised ba lounge in terminal at pearson is small but quiet compared to others great window seats overlooking tarmac separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this red eye that left at meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar drink choices perfectly adequate staff very helpful and cordial flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful the seats must be the most talked about issue for ba club world they do indeed pack them in compared to any other business class flight i have taken that said seats fully reclined i had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable aside from take off and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler cost of flight was less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good as a side note connected on to madrid and ba lounges at lhr are fantastic w
1404, london heathrow to zakinthos from parking meet and greet to inside the lounge via bag drop security and three shops took only minutes boarding on time greeted warmly managed to grab the front row at online check in from take off the purser looked after the business cabin brilliantly drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking meal served quickly carpaccio of melon with a prawn miso cod not overcooked wasabi mash and veg average dessert and cheese and crackers wine topped up regularly coffee in a mug all through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin priority offload and separate bus to terminal fairly quick passport control and bags coming onto the belt as we got through the crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor apart from delay in leaving heathrow fab 
1405, london to vancouver i booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable our outward flight to vancouver was delayed by approx an hour we were seated on the top deck and i was impressed by the room we had window aisle and middle seats the crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks pillows etc food was ok the kids mac cheese was better than the adult meals entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way on our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely food was again just ok we had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep he was drenched and i had no spare clothes for him i spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn t be more helpful she found some first class pjs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight she really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me out i was pleasently surprised by ba on both legs of our journey and i wouldn t hesitate to book with them again just a shame they can t up their game food wise 
1406, london to sao paulo an exceptionally ordinary flight both for good and for bad cabin crew were disinterested i was made to feel intrusive when i asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service something i d never felt before i felt somewhat snubbed when after asking for help being short loading my exit row hand luggage into the ohls the fa took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had two tablets in and is fragile so should be stacked on top of mine and didn t bother to ask me about the contents of my bag my laptop speakers haven t worked since i slept through dinner service but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast a continental charcuterie option would go down a treat on this route i imagine but we had a choice of flaccid english breakfast or flaccid omelette my first ba economy flight after travelling long haul in premium economy and club cabins i can see why this is the bargain fare but still better than several competitors i felt safe we arrived early the crew were for the most part friendly what s more to ask for 
1407, i had a return flight to istanbul in club europe staff were usual ba quality however flight experience was awful club europe section with no leg space there was no inflight entertainment lounge in istanbul probably one of the worst i have been to drinks some cakes and pastry nothing else i am sorry to see that british airways become a budget airline 
1408, on a flight from bangkok to london and you ll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices first meal service has thai green curry veg and the second thai red curry chicken really no one could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns i said i don t want the prawns for starter as i m having the prawn main meal i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off ok so prawns for starter and i ll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce mashed potatoes mushroom spinach and tomato well i m not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i wasn t eating them the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it mushrooms were very meh tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible the bread roll didn t win any prizes either i just gave up and refused to eat it now when this was served i d been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly no problem press the call bell which is reset before anyone comes press it again and think i d better get on with eating my food eventually some one arrives and notices i m not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no one has answered my call button obviously i m just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and i ll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice this does not appear for fifteen minutes during that time i am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn t going work for me so a couple of hours later i m a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks back at my seat i think i need a g t with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin there is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin i do find one in the second galley i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times i ve tried to use it and been ignored bad service now on to the second meal service strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu i ask the fa about this but am just told everyone is having the same no explanation the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again ok main meal i m give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembark just not recommended at all 
1409, flew rome to london gatwick big disappointment i paid to fly with british airways just for one way and the plane was delayed two hours and minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft instead of arriving at we landed almost at midnight no refreshments were offered nothing the customs queue was massive i got home at in the morning i decided to pay extra for ba instead of flying ryanair and it was a huge mistake even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work ba is not worth the extra money staff did not speak a word of italian 
1410, having flown first class from london to cape town and club back from johannesburg i have really noticed a significant downgrade in ba service and standards compared to premium flights i have taken in previous years the seats in first had crumbs on them on arrival in club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadn t been cleaned on the return club flight in particular the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower on occasions i had to ask for a g t eventually i only received it by going to the galley it was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation food in club was average first lounge in t not great sole elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from leaving a scribbled paper sign saying back in an hour which wasn t helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at pm when i tried to book an appointment on her return she told me she was busy and full whilst checking facebook on her iphone in terms of hard product the club seat just doesn t compare with rivals any more it s way too narrow and storage space is dire these flights were miles burn i won t be accruing more avios with ba 
1411, london to milan having read about ba s cut backs on service i approached my flight with slight trepidation i was not too disappointed though the flights were smooth and left on time seating fairly comfortable consider is was a minute flight pre board and on board announcements were efficient and informative the downside however was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray although ba on european routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do i still expected some efficiency it was tediously slow with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley the glossy m s menu looked good but too laborious to get some food and pay for it with some families split up paying for items took longer with some getting impatient and noisy by the time the trolley reached the back of the aircraft the descent had already begun it is a shame that our national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline is anything but come on ba get your act together or at least like a quote i once read we are like british rail love we may be late but we re getting there 
1412, london heathrow to bucharest a full flight both ways to bucharest using a a boarding in london was efficient and orderly the boarding in bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum any sense of control by ba went out of the window the plane was clean but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges there was no usb ports or entertainment which makes for a long hours the m s meal service worked well flying out of london but less so returning food inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out leaving a selection of drinks and crisps also the ba cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently which slows the process down too 
1413, london heathrow to bologna i have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from a to b for a competitive price the planes were clean and modern however like many i do feel sad that the service on ba has been downgraded so drastically the buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about mins before landing it s hard to say it is so slow other airlines are much more efficient the crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight i thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in italian to be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those i have taken with easyjet so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline 
1414, london heathrow to keflavik was a good experience club europe cabin was not really a business class cabin but economy with the centre seat converted into a table other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine the meals served was very good with a simple starter decent hot main course and tasty dessert there was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight the senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you the cabin was clean in both directions boarding the plane both in london and keflavik was straightforward 
1415, larnaca to london heathrow despite being an executive member and booking seats months before on most flights my last flights i have had my seats changed last time my family split up despite booking row last september had this have been a one off then i wouldn t mind so much but this is the third time in months i have called ba and even emailed social media team even at the airport i tried to rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to tell me why the service and attitude of ba now is shocking since alex cruz came in the airline has gone downhill so fast it s hard to believe 
1416, san jose to london gatwick return the outward flight was delayed for an hour at san jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals on the flight i was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the ife it would have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to the cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice the food was of good quality so it was despite the delay a good experience on the return boarding was swift and efficient and the cabin staff once again friendly and helpful food not as interesting as on the outward leg but perfectly acceptable i usually try to take a cheaper flight involving connections but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense 
1417, london to keflavik british airways lost one of my bags on our way to iceland for a week long vacation this is understandable bags get delayed all the time however when i attempted to contact british airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room i was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers the delayed bag contained our sleeping bags and tent for a one week camping trip not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in iceland cost upwards of a night we were forced to sleep in our rental car until the next day when we were able to rent a tent since making my claim for reimbursement british airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursement i have been told my partner who purchased the tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the baggage was under my name paid for by me and all costs for tent rental and toiletry items were paid with my credit card it is shameful that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorly i urge you to avoid at all costs 
1418, tokyo haneda to london heathrow this was the return leg of a code share flight with jal i flew jal on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious on my return i felt embarrassed that ba is our national airline mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality white fish consisted of tiny pieces of fish surrounded by a brown fatty unidentifiable flavourless mass the tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush service was efficient bordering on perfunctory luckily we brought some other food on board please ba either do away with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising less embarrassing fare you can t stay stuck in the middle for long 
1419, absolutely appalling airline would definetly not recommend flew rome to london heathrow compared to the likes of qatar emirates and qantas they do not come close i will never travel with british airways again flights delayed from london to rome by over hr between captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions the food is shocking and over priced the planes are out dated there stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff 
1420, amsterdam to gatwick check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check in desk the staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time the welcome on board was exceptional however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight ie nothing exceptional or poor the seats looked very appealing but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while this is a great shame for a good looking cabin we took off twenty minutes after the intended time due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time however the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay and the current progress in making up the lost time overall the flight was pretty regular from ba but the good ground staff useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew made it a good service 
1421, flew zurich to london heathrow i have flown times with british airways in the last months i ve seen a noticeable degradation of service flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down they were once smart and full of energy sadly they seem to have lost their pride a huge shame 
1422, new york to cape town via london heathrow a huge disappointment even worse when you put it in context of what british airways used to be we decided to fly first because i can t stand club world backward seats forward facing seats almost on the aisle claustrophic poor overhead storage on some planes seats were narrow poor seat controls unable to independently control the different seat axes foot rest had to be set manually american airlines and cathay pacific new business class products are far better than ba first class avod great on one leg with the new pansonic system dreadful on the nd leg with the old system food was mediocre at best breakfast jfk to lhr was passable dinner lhr to cpt passible wife s fish was okay my hamburger was inedible meal service slow cabin crew from jfk was excellent to cape town was passable changing planes in heathrow t t a nightmar i am oneworld emerald never again
1423, managed to get upper deck which is rare flying from london to philadelphia cabin was unclean with earbuds and paper on floor from previous flight no hello for gold status it became clear british airways are some sort of work to rule one stewardess for all upstairs three hours to serve dinner which was bland and tasteless cabin service director never appeared once despite my tv screen refusing to stay in open position never ever again will i pay thousands of pounds for bland insulting service 
1424, florence to bristol a positive first experience and i will try to fly ba in the future when i booked the flight for myself and my and year olds i was automatically allocated seats no charge kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest a few hours before the flight during online check in i noticed my daughter s name mispelt on the ticket i telephoned ba s hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and i received a call back with an update part way through the process no charge and no hassle all staff from customer services to ground staff to in flight crew were friendly staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child we were given a meal with water and a further drink on our h m flight on this flight to bristol everything is included in your ticket we had soft drinks but a couple in front had g ts our meal was salmon with couscous bread cheese and a mint on the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie the meals were actually really nice both our flights did depart late for different and what i believe were unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to italy still arrived early some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn t got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up i wasn t bothered which airline i flew with my criteria were that i could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and ba came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight my criteria will still exist but i will certainly be looking at ba first in the future 
1425, salzburg to gatwick awful experience flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and ba handling in salzburg did apologise for the delay once boarded with a full flight there were crew members to serve club with about passengers and to serve about or more economy passengers usual fight for bag space i was desperate for some water and asked the crew can i buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin i am in seat c right at the back i am told no i have to wait for the trolley i wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to gatwick the trolley gets to seat row the members of crew are still struggling to take card payments and tell row that the service is now closed and pass the trolley back to the behind galley all this as the csd stands chatting in the club galley with the other crew member of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a hour dinner time flight no smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling not even a flight map to help pass time terrible airline a national disgrace worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service i am only rating this as as they got me from a to b safely 
1426, nice to london heathrow you must downgrade your rating of british airways if you truly reflect how bad things have become flight delayed that happens i accept but the ba ground staff handling was awful to the point of zero in reality once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space pilot did give a polite and nice apology but the cabin staff service that has always been their stronger point was terrible aside from the fact stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads most unpleasant in a confined space their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude they seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us and that is just not acceptable sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness ba management should be fired or at least the ceo mr cruz who is destroying our national airline i m not a grumpy old man just a customer with over years experience of flying british airways and boac and bea and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline 
1427, athens to newcastle via london another miserable experience woken at am by text to say flight to heathrow cancelled for operational reasons phone numbers listed to rearrange one not open till am gmt the greek one no longer in use website also useless we are experiencing technical difficulties try again later stressful hours later managed to get rebooked onto much later flights but downgraded on both sectors still not happy that i was involuntarily downgraded on my last ba flight at easter athens used to have a great ba lounge now it s provided by someone else for varied airlines and was pretty grim partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight flights adequate but no different really to service of any budget airline crew apologetic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in ba s direction athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain claim ba are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew without them i d have already deserted still waiting for any response from airline re eu compensation downgrade almost weeks after submitting forms emails this could surely be automatic managed by most us airlines and contrasts with a recent air france experience of far more trivial nature where within hours i d received a voucher and a personal apology 
1428, london heathrow to paris orly terminal busy lounge was ok but kids area t north limited we had to take our youngest downstairs aircraft was ok but could have been cleaner lunch was ok for this short sector in summary all was ok however we really do expect more in the premium cabins it is with regret that i have to admit that i have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another provider ba will not retain their premium clients if they continue with their current model i am sure that those who use point etc will remain loyal however those of us who pay their hard earned cash for club world will begin to take their business elsewhere it s not this particular flight that s at fault more a general trend downwards 
1429, toulouse to london heathrow this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was one of the lucky ones who doesn t remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for days i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may this incidentally ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my pre paid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent their customer service is beyond atrocious i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you get is bear with us we re trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center based in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost non existent information provided on their website on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers would they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic control s fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival as i mentioned i have been one of their luckier passengers 
1430, london city to dusseldorf return flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering the outward flight there were passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us the young stewardess took our orders then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports check in did not open until minutes before the fight to lcy and hours before the flight to lhr i can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf as the flight to lcy may only have max pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle which looked totally out of place in uniform the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with pax and only meals which meant that passengers were offered a so called ham chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process i was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agents at dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of passengers case behind the handling agents at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight i did phone on monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport about hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport they will be put on the late flight tonight which means i will get it nearly days after it became missed it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted 
1431, what is happening to british airways flew vancouver to london the a has to be my favorite long haul aircraft but ba is definitely not cabin crew were friendly and professional despite not being a full complement of crew several dishes were crossed off the menu apparently due to ongoing dispute why food was inedible the worst i have ever been served on a business flight the seat configuration is outdated blankets threadbare and pancake thin pillows the constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see they need to spend some time on a singapore airlines aircraft to see what business class really is ba s golden years are well and truly over it will take a miracle to bring them back 
1432, johannesburg to london heathrow premium economy very spacious with inch seat pitch very good ife the crew serving this section were excellent polite engaging and fun amenity kits appreciated chicken curry was delicious my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they had eaten on an airline impressed with warm bread rolls plenty of wine did not eat breakfast negatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row elderly cabin abreast seating on boeing compared to abreast on the a outward from london to johannesburg the upper deck premium economy cabin on a is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on boeing aircraft nice wide selection on ife once again excellent young and polite crew beef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was delicious negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in jnb although hot breakfast was offered which i didn t partake in overall a very good experience and would recommend ba 
1433, flew oslo to philadelphia via london was extremely disappointed with business class on british airways the flat beds were very narrow and i m only and weigh lbs and therefore not very comfortable the lunch served beef entree was inedible except for the tomato mozzerella starter the cheese and the dessert i had wanted shrimp salad but was told it was unavailable afternoon tea was better but certainly not stellar the so called warm scone was stone cold and the sandwiches were still very cold from being refrigerated i had asked for both a diet coke and an apple and the steward forgot both requests 
1434, london to warsaw i have not flown with ba within the eu for a while and decided to take this chance to fly with them on a trip to poland i had paid more than gbp for a return ticket and had no free food services whatsoever you need to pay for your food on board if you decide to go on a cheap marketing promotion please lower your ticket fares down more in line with easyjet or ryanair 
1435, athens to london with british airways to call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke to start with british airways lounge is provided by skyways which as jammed with both people and a bad assortment of food the actual seat d had no power plugs and no tv at the front of the seat what you find in economy in canada the seat width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic flying premium economy on cathay pacific is dramatically superior the flight from heathrow to athens was on a very beat up b on aug the food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid it is amazing that they can attempt to call this level of service business very disappointing 
1436, cairo to montreal via london days i m waiting my baggage absolutely no information from british airways customer services in india and they cut off conversation often no contact with british airways you paid full price for a low cost service absolutely no customer consideration heathrow is a nightmare for baggage 
1437, london to chicago i am a ba gold member and reserved three ba business class tickets to chicago returning from denver i selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself would sit together a week before departure i received a message from ba informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day on the departure date we checked smoothly at the business class counter at lhr the fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem the lounge attendant however curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes i checked and it was true but i had not suspected it at all till that point since i had paid for business class believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at check in the customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasn t him who downgraded the ticket i spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights but they were all full he could not confirm if ba had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade he had no explanation for why ba did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance nor did he acknowledge that ba had made any mistake in this ordeal however he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation we ended up traveling in economy class to add insult to injury the airline was unable to place us next to each other so the family was split seven rows apart however the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first they almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff 
1438, nice to london heathrow i had to fly to nice and back for work booked through the company travel agency extra bag added both ways i wanted to fly back to lhr earlier so my travel agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of gbp when i arrived at nce the ground staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag saying that it was for the earlier flight i stood my ground but the head of check in told me if i wanted to fly i had to pay eur which i did under duress i had prebooked my seat as silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which i loathe as the is claustrophobic i asked for my bags to be offloaded and i would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate the trend for ba in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource check in staff who have no comprehension of the ba system combined with an arrogant ignorance that means i will not be choosing this airline again i have one more flight with them next week and that s it i paid almost pounds to get to nice and back today in economy i was greeted with disdain by ground staff the crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who despite the high prices have the audacity to charge pounds for a gin and tonic aircraft are tired and worn toilets stink please do yourself a favour and book someone else 
1439, london to doha my flight got cancelled due to cabin crew strikes i had no choice but to fly on this day due to work commitment the class i had booked was not available on the alternative qatar airways flight and british airways refused to upgrade me so they could only downgrade to economy i would rate british airways way below the normal standard of customer satisfaction 
1440, paris cdg to london it is difficult to find anything positive to write about ba flight delayed not their fault but for nearly an hour the staff didn t communicate or interact with the cabin they had a good old chat at the front one even deciding it was time to snooze for a dollar minute flight we should get better we just seem to be an inconvenience as passengers and no one cares that an extra hour on the ground in a unclean aircraft terrible and not worth the money 
1441, gatwick to paphos chaos at check in as another system failure leg room was shocking for a hour flight definately a low cost airline now no food drink ife and paying for luggage long haul ba has barely maintained its standards but short haul british airways has become a disgrace 
1442, unimpressed service very indifferent impression that it s only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight perfunctory service at best guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy british airways calls their economy world traveller i wonder if those at the top making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the much superior service most other airlines offer even in economy ba take a page from qantas to see what economy service looks like my understanding is ba recently lost a star and are now only stars quite understandable from what was offered on this flight food awful dinner of chicken rice and peas breakfast over ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars awful even a recent united flight from syd to sfo served better meals no return of crew to offer more beverages and no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer the wine offering was the best part a reasonably good spanish pinot gris there are alternatives to the uk from canada air canada air transat westjet on westjet you purchase your food but i m sure it has to be superior to ba s offering my last flight to britain on air canada was much superior air france last october to paris was excellent qantas to australia is always brilliant the only redeeming factor on this flight was the airbus still the smoothest and quietest plane flying apparently british airways ceo is an accountant and the bean counting shows in the service and food quality offered service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to britain s flag carrier 
1443, british aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world well known for outstanding inflight service decent food comfortable seats good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines how times have changed under recent ceos most notably the current holder the post alex cruz ba has declined to the level of a budget airline in fact i ve had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers flying from vancouver to london on the a was superb it s a wonderful aircraft beyond that atrocious dinner was a tough piece of chicken over cooked vegetables and dried up rice breakfast was a farce a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar hardly suitable breakfast fare the entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight no snacks no water offering between meals nothing on the same route air canada is superior in every way it s very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a ceo who s strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines 
1444, british airways is quickly becoming a low quality low cost services but premium priced airline apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with marks spencer buy on board menu on that particular flight they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay it was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion next time we ll just fly another airline that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices this came only a month after the major it failure that grounded all ba flights for a weekend the only thing they have left is safety if they lose that then it s over 
1445, catania to gatwick about min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight it took hours for the trolley to reach row our row there was no food left not even a kit kat we had the last can of coca cola and a bottle of water several factors contributed to this silly situation ba trying to become a low cost airline i did not realise that it had sunk so low when i booked the fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay the blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling ba trying to keep the front toilet for business class passengers totally inadequate supply of food on board the aircraft this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger would accept 
1446, venice to gatwick problems encountered on th july at venice marco polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight ba back to gatwick from various conversations that took place it would appear that there were no british airways staff at venice marco polo airport everything is handled by the local service agents obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents they need to be made aware and re trained if necessary as no doubt ba are paying them money to carry out their duties announcements were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help after arriving at we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost hour away arriving at the following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flight deck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed i am all for safe flying but ba need to improve their standards 
1447, bucharest to london which takes hours this is my second bad experience with ba if you want to eat something then you have to pay for it they did not offer me a glass of water my first experience was when i flew from miami to london on june th and that flight was delayed for hours the ground transportation from one terminal to another is awful also at heathrow airport 
1448, the london heathrow to accra flight is regularly late leaving lhr by hours as a regular on this route for years i have spent many hours delayed at lhr started well with ba at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check gate rather than the far gates at t hand luggage is a problem on this sector all looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for first gold business etc to come forward it is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a ba premium passenger one first class passenger told the gate assistant to take control back of the gate she blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff it was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into accra a little early a first for me in years on the route once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly a shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with poor food poor seats in a layout that defies any sense lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month catch up with the others ba 
1449, gatwick to orlando return possibly the worst pre and post flight experience i can remember hrs late on the way out almost three hours late on the return journey bas use of old aircraft is to blame a failed ife that couldn t be repaired took two hours to try and remedy after this failed a replacement plane was required by the time this arrived ba realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours this led to a further hr delay waiting for a standby crew this was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by ba no refreshments provided no accurate information just endless waiting they didn t board the children first and it was a total mess the plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to tampa due to low fuel whilst this seems fair enough the plane was actually hr late leaving gatwick in the first place so had it left on time it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did a terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called british as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as i can see i will not be using ba again 
1450, san diego to london heathrow the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the so whilst it s not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat i m a slim size and could not turn around in my seat there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed but does not line up with the rest of the seat so your feet are raised the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around every time the person next to you moves your chair moves too the hydraulics must be connected it was very annoying the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drinks meal tray did not stay put it was not secure and basically was flimsy and unusable i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap i was in seat a which was a rear facing window seat there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne so for the first minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face very awkward the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn t stay put it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle the food well the fillet streak was tough and dry i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a with american airlines and they did a much better job the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice service if you want good service don t get a window seat you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew forget you are even there i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head not ideal with some turbulence there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such apparently the boeing does not have the right equipment in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin the layout is impractical seats are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored the is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly the tv s stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal i for one will not be flying ba business again 
1451, flew british airways from pisa to london gatwick the two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure we had hand baggage only and had already checked in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security the queue was pretty hectic and it took minutes to get through although we were flying economy as ba gold members we had access to the lounge the lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge we left the lounge minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control the queue was long and slow and took minutes to get through once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers we received the magic beep and were upgraded to club europe both of us are gold members we were seated in row it was the typical seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed leg room not great but we are both short after take off we were offered drinks i had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle we were then offered afternoon tea consisting of three finger sandwiches beef egg and tuna and a slice of victoria sponge cake all very tasty but i do miss the scones in club europe i also managed two top ups of champagne the cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested the flight arrived on time and we were on a train within minutes of landing overall we paid each for the flight and with the upgrade was a bargain 
1452, the flight from budapest to london was delayed by hours during which time british airways offered nothing no help with hotel reservations despite limited hotel availability due to the world swimming championships no food no transport to and from the airport in fact ba doesn t even have a representative in budapest having outsourced it to a hungarian agent who did their best in the absence of any input from ba even the customer service desk i phoned was answered from india also outsourced when the flight finally took off we could not even buy food on the plane we were told that a ba representative would meet us at our heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers but he she wisely didn t show up because i for one was looking for a voucher for hours of my life which i won t get back rather than some airport food vouchers i have flown several times a month for the last years with many airlines and have never been treated as badly i will be flying abba anything but ba from now on 
1453, british airways cancelled my flight and put me on a eva air flight which had a different baggage allowance and i had to pay a excess i thought that because my booking was with ba they should pay the excess which they refused to do after months of refusing to acknowledge any responsibility i had to issue a court summons on which they admitted they were at fault i have flown over different airlines and never had a company behave this way when they are obviously in the wrong 
1454, singapore to newcastle via london heathrow terrible airline avoid at all costs was affected by the global it outage during the bank holiday weekend had to wait in line two hours to get a new ticket they were terribly slow after the whole episode i wrote an e mail requesting compensation for the flight delay my misplaced baggage it s now july and i still have not gotten back my monies extremely poor customer service wrote e mails twice chasing them for the refunds they said they will check that was more than a week ago and haven t heard from them yet as for the flight experience poor they have become so budget that they do not even provide necessary toiletries like toothbrush for long haul flights in flight entertainment was also poor very limited selection of movies 
1455, bergen to london heathrow i was a gold executive member for years and raved about ba sadly that has hugely changed this year i flew from london to frankfurt with my daughter and we had to buy food on board i found this highly irregular especially for a mainstream airline today i flew from bergen to london and again experience ended this this is disgusting ba charge way higher prices than others and very much more than the cheapie lines and now also charge for food in economy the entire executive team should be fired and ba have lost another client 
1456, newcastle to boston via london flight from newcastle to heathrow fine although paying for a cup of tea with avios was not especially slick a superb flight from heathrow to boston even though it was the day the latest ba strike started th july left slightly late due to heathrow computer problems earlier in the day but we were kept fully informed about progress seats on b comfortable with plenty of legroom in the bassinet seats cabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate reassuring updates from the cockpit food really pretty good dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for me entertainment not bad at all had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airport all ba crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for ba i would happily fly with them again soon 
1457, flew from london heathrow to sofia i have been flying british airways for over years and they are truly awful now i see no difference now with easyjet or ryanair the main difference with ba now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff i encountered everything in t is now self service including bag drop paid food etc 
1458, flew last week london to frankfurt no light refreshments complimentary crew busy operating card terminals etc makes less time to be nice to passengers then asking what was complimentary informed tap water and it came no ice or offer on the return i was given a mid seat asking if there was a free aisle i was told no waiting till all boarded i sat in a free aisle the airline continues to pretend to have high standards but it slips further and further into the depths of i will book with ba if no other airlines available 
1459, this was a one way avios redemption flight fare cost and avios each as a ba gold member i used the first class wing at t this included direct access to the galleries first lounge we were through very quickly as there was no queue at security the lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch the former had better food offering the sausages and mushrooms very tasty lunch wasn t very good i ordered a ba burger the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless she left most of it the buffet selection wasn t particularly interesting some chicken potatoes veggie curry and chilli my wife said the curry was okay but the chilli i tried was bland the drinks on offer were decent a gin festival was on although i don t drink the stuff the choice looked extensive i had a few glasses of henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful castlenau they used to have but not as good as the taittinger they served a year ago i tried a few sips of a kiwi pinot gris can t remember what it was called but it was very nice finally i couldn t resist a shot of johnnie walker blue the first class lounge itself needs some tlc the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked i normally try to fly another oneworld airline other than ba but if it has to be ba then i prefer to fly from t for the excellent cathay pacific lounge in fact i prefer the new ba gatwick first lounge than the galleries t the flight itself was okay it pushed back slightly late and arrived at bologna on time i didn t bother with the bob as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in bologna cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the bob offering we sat in a pair of two seats next to door l really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning we were one of the last passengers to exit it was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took minutes to get though passport control then a further minute wait for our luggage despite a lot of moans about ba on this forum i can t really complain about the overall experience as a gold member the lounge access was free but if i paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes i d be disappointed 
1460, we did a return trip from heathrow to jfk and there were only two good things about flying british airways you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked terminal five at heathrow the rest was disappointing the outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule there was no apology the return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain there was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an g chocolate bar it felt like being in school cabin crew weren t overly friendly on either journey inflight entertainment was fine lots of films both new and old to watch we would usually fly emirates or virgin but decided to fly ba to give it a go if you have similar thoughts don t do it we won t be flying with ba again they are not worth it it is very british elitist and inefficient 
1461, london heathrow to berlin return will be taking anything but ba flights from now on arriving at berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile items another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no both times the ground staff were inconsitant rude and uncooperative i was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat the new seat configuration is so narrow now i could not get into the allocated seat as i have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat i put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker the steward without telling me or consulting me moved it when i queried this i was told madam i know what i am doing i have done this before i am years old and i refuse to be so patronised so i was ready for a stand up row by this time fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation no food left at the back of the plane as usual why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service if i want a budget flight i will use easyjet anytime 
1462, barcelona to boston via london mixed review we had to rebook suddenly for next day business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently ba cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune the good flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful food was surprisingly good wheelchair attendants at lhr were wonderful the bad a business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked boeing business class seats were very comfortable but a seat in the middle of the seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest lhr connection of hr was barely enough for terminal to transfer ba representative said hr would be adequate even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus also a nasty surprise no wifi on a hr transatlantic flight 
1463, london to madrid a weekend flight heathrow check in was fairly chaotic for early morning check in and security but once through was okay full flight and gate staff being quite keen to check passenger hand luggage but managed to get through with my pieces flight deck very informative about slight delay cabin crew struggled to get through the buy onboard service and i managed to get a single coffee after very very long wait it is quite a short flight and the fare was low so cannot complain too much but ba is now no different to easyjet flybe etc 
1464, london heathrow to brussels return through work i have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a ba flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed even in the premium cabins if your timing is right the prices reflect this that is before the add on s so be prepared to get on last be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row and eat and drink before you board unless of course you are happy to pay more that way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up it s a win any flights longer than a couple of hours i strenuously avoid ba if i can a shame because in some ways i grew up with ba back in the days of boac and bea having said that the flights to and from brussels were ok in a full aircraft either way 
1465, london heathrow to accra flight left nearly two hours late bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure this is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage chaos in economy class on this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than hr to departure when will ba realise this flights needs at least mins to board it is the most delayed flight out of heathrow because of this poor management fact the ground staff did nothing to control the crowds simple and polite requests would have helped the grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers once on board the crew were friendly and professional very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seats the cold salad options are far better than the hot offering in ba s club class still no wi fi on ba even discount carriers like norwegian have this now let along the flag carriers like emirates and qatar airways 
1466, krakow to london got us there fine my main issue is the food service i was sat in row probably of the way back it was an evening weekday flight so everyone tired hungry their new m s service was a disaster the flight was just over hours it took hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row by the time it arrived all that was available was a kitkat and some other sweets they had already run out of sandwiches hot food it took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card and the machine seemed to keep on having problems also the variety on the new m s menu whilst generally a good thing meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored have to say this services is no better than easyjet i will think twice about travelling with ba if it wasn t paid for by work i would not have travelled with them the service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier 
1467, gatwick to bridgetown i managed to locate some seats that offered reasonable leg room i am over ft although after feeling the knees of the passenger sitting behind me i think he was not so lucky we had a delay in take off but apologies provided food was okay and i was pleasantly surprised crew members were hard working polite and professional the boeing was showing signs of age g viiw but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year this plane appeared more cared for i am concerned how ba are going to shoehorn abreast instead of the current i cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possible overall the experience was good on this occasion the ife was old but worked it did not last time 
1468, dubai to london didn t have high expectations but surprised how bland and uninteresting this journey was started in an uninspiring visit to the ba lounge with a poor food choice and poky plane was just about clean but rather poor for business class the menu was poor and entertainment the worst i have seen afternoon tea was an afterthought and the forty minute wait for a gate at lhr really summed up the state of ba today bland uninspiring and lacking the passion to serve not a patch on qatar airways or emirates and makes you feel quite inadequate as a brit
1469, london heathrow to sofia flight was on time and ground service was smooth however our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen but no any choice or apology was offered for silver member no complimentary service onboard provided crew even had problem with the payment machine luckily i ve got some water and treats from the airport shops cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats now ba is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines i ve abandoned my silver status and considering using other airlines i m still using ba as well in cases when the fare is competitive on the route 
1470, mauritius to gatwick club world efficient check in third party lounge at mauritius airport was a reasonable place to spend time before the flight with usual facilities on time departure welcomed with warm glass of champagne cabin ok though was a little grubby in places food selection mediocre for dinner the meze starter was average at best my main of pasta was bland and tasteless some of the cabin crew attending to my wife were not as helpful as they could have been toilets kept clean throughout flight reasonable breakfast i note the removal of the arrivals lounge at lgw after a hours flight this would have been quite welcome 
1471, new york jfk london heathrow the british airways lounge at jfk is truly terrible it seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other i wasn t allowed into the first class lounge despite being a ba gold list member so much for loyalty was instructed at check in that this was a sleeper service and i should eat in the lounge not an advisory but an instruction the club world food on offer in the lounge for the dining experience was overcooked and of very poor quality usual cub world service on ba which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle poor food they did offer food poor in flight entertainment putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up ba train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again to serve food and drinks the crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly the product and offer from ba is so mediocre i even saw club class passengers taking their own food on for example the other carriers must be laughing as they take over ba in terms of service and quality of aircraft shameful 
1472, a packed flight from athens to london heathrow cabin crew spent quite a bit of time selling food and drinks from a trolley everything had to be purchased i had to go to the back for a glass of tap water complimentary small tv screens hanging at intervals displayed the flight route minimal interaction with crew seat was fine bag space overhead was ample no charge for that plane arrived on time which was a relief as i had to change terminals to catch a connection i had two hours and made it the travel was followed up by a customer survey by the airline i was glad when the four hour flight ended nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that 
1473, venice to gatwick i am done with british airways it has the worst service and incredibly rude staff we were supposed to fly back from venice at p m on th july the flight was delayed by an hour and a half ba policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours fair enough however what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport the only cafe at the vce airport available to customers after security was shutting at around pm when i went to buy some water the guy at the counter refused outright another lady had been there since am her flight earlier that day was delayed and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher the guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude my partner tweeted about this to ba and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone s pics at the same time we finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too there was not one person from british airways this whole time till am in the morning as if this wasn t enough when boarding started and we were showing our tickets we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us we were the tenth twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us there was no sign or announcement separating the two queues instead of politely mentioning that this member of ba staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line by then the so called priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone when i mentioned this she told me that i was cutting the queue and wasting her time we just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did i am definitely never going to choose ba again 
1474, new york jfk to manchester via heathrow budget airline trying to retain a big name brand flight was cancelled then booked then delayed aircraft was diverted to liverpool whereby the passengers were subsequently abandondoned poor quality no aftercare and ba customer service extremely poor in responding to complaints when they eventually did the shrugged it off as not their problem disappointing and won t be flying ba again 
1475, after flying boston to london on the a i returned on a recently retrofitted boeing the seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the a the seatback tv and in flight entertainment had been significantly upgraded the only part of the cabin s aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights which hadn t been replaced the cabin crew was polite professional and accommodating no complaints there the captain even gave us a personal genuine announcement before takeoff which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long haul flight the flight itself was comfortable at hours minutes and without delay on either end while i m a bit concerned that ba is at risk of turning into a low cost carrier under the current leadership my experience was that his crew are still doing a great job 
1476, naples to gatwick i used to admire and love ba i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessings we had once again been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife s preference states that she likes a window seat and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other but why does ba have to keep doing this the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks food and magazines when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passengers were invited to board first there was no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished once boarded we were unlike the other club europe passengers not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seats so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it means one gets only a smallish glassful so has to ask for a refill something not everybody likes to do this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost cutting exercise on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to ba s website at the time we were told at all these airports ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples she was told no but at least we knew beforehand or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the check in staff not have told us the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too bad know what we showed our boarding pass then had to stand no seats available in a very cramped area for minutes before the gate was opened in other words we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers 
1477, toronto to london heathrow i am a ba exec silver member and paid over return for business flight as had work straight after flying both journeys originally was a boeing but they changed planes to an old boeing on both journeys the flat business seat on yyz lhr was broken and cabin service director couldn t fix it the bench part was inches different level to main seat extremely uncomfortable and didn t sleep a wink no extra pillows available in either business or first food inedible on both journeys outbound fillet of british beef was as tough as old rope they should be ashamed of the business breakfast on the yyz lhr as i ve had better in a greasy joe s cafe also the wine printed on the menu not available on both legs a case of over promising and under delivering again simply miles behind the competition the csd completed a complaint for me and i also wrote to alex cruz their customer services team offered me in vouchers what planet is he on now they have a very angry and dissatisfied customer it is not the money it is the principle 
1478, london to montreal i have also flown their economy plus montreal to london and business class london tokyo london rome return ba economy is on a par with ryanair business is okay economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food regardless of class of travel the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition the following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller i started watching a movie on the flight from montreal to london but the last min of the movie were missing it looked like the recording consisted of only the first min out of min total of the movie in the next few days i tried to see the last part of the movie on other two ba flights business and economy plus and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing in addition to this minor problem all ba flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise once again the same problem applied to all flights 
1479, return flights from newcastle to geneva via london heathrow in club europe check in at newcastle rapid without a queue fast track worked well lounge was ok but limited selection of food onboard all flights the domestic and european biz class is fine seats with decent legroom choice of food chicken salad charcuterie and cheese and good quality drinks the staff were lovely professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors crew from gva lhr particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival all of this during the mixed fleet strike dates t south lounge at lhr was like a sauna and access impossible from south security involves a long walk downstairs then up again north lounge better on return but bathrooms generally dirty and in need of an update tagged priority bags were literally the last on the belt at geneva which was a joke but likely not ba s fault first off back in newcastle overall the short haul business product is perfectly adequate if for nothing other than skipping queues ba s lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job 
1480, london to keflavik the british airways experience has certainly changed i m happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and that s not always the case when flying with low cost airlines terminal is one of the best terminals at heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight but the staff greeted us with a smile the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable it s bring your own entertainment and you ll have to purchase both food and drinks which we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite good i like the ba service touch it manages to be both nice and efficient we had a nice smooth flight home to iceland at the end of our vacation and i can honestly say that i m looking forward to my next flight with ba 
1481, i was a bit nervous when i booked my bristish airways return flight from london tokyo but i had a really pleasant experience the flight attendants were lovely attentive prompt and sweet i m a nervous flyer so i tend to drink a lot and i never felt judged or like i was bothering them by ordering another the food was good plenty of in flight movie options and the pilot was very reassuring i m not really sure what else i could need also the price of the ticket was affordable 
1482, gatwick to mauritius very disappointed to see the decline in quality from ba since i last flew with them for a flight of hours to mauritius i was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that ba seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length possibly the least comfortable airline seat i ve ever had with every lump and bump imaginable and the infuriating headrest which doesn t stay up slipping down and banging you in the neck every minutes the seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket legroom also very poor albeit i am above average height but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me the food was also poor no snacks offered and the meals were slop i have flown air nz virgin emirates and ba in the last two years and ba was the poorest in terms of food and comfort good points the cabin crew were reasonably good toilets were clean and the in flight entertainment worked fine with a good selection but that wasn t enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience 
1483, boston to barcelona via london i am a silver ba card holder and reserved two flights myself and my wife from boston to london heathrow in premium economy and heathrow to barcelona in economy class i paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying on check in at boston we were given different seats for the heathrow to barcelona sector than i had reserved in the exit row due to a change of aircraft configuration although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change in early june i applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and was given a case number to date there has been no communication or refund from ba in spite of my sending a second email asking for information overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures we will not be flying transatlantic with ba in the future after years of several crossings each year in an article about british airways in the financial times on nd june it said that their customers are less and less happy but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important 
1484, gatwick to mauritius in business class the check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at gatwick is nice boarding was fine and pre selected seats retained the layout and features were standard of club world and service of the level expected the club kitchen was fairly limited in its offerings half the entertainment did not work properly if at all in short acceptable service flight left and arrived on time however ba should take note that for this route emirates were less expensive and would have offered an a offering on both legs the reason for choosing ba was the fact it was a direct service 
1485, london heathrow to larnaca british airways was once the flagship airline of the uk you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches they even charge for water and if you don t have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they don t take cash i did not mind paying that bit extra for ba flights but now better off with easyjet 
1486, london to hong kong in premium economy i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review of my six flights this year three were seriously delayed one was from oslo to london on th june when the captain decided to wait for some business class passengers who hadn t made their way out of the lounge in time for take off my worst experience however was going to hong kong on th may when there was a technical fault with the plane the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time who then sat on the plane for almost three hours without being offered any water or other refreshments and with little information and apologies before an hour flight i was in premium economy but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets which meant that i got no rest during the night how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet the in flight service was poor as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy as it is just a lousy offer seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy but don t recline as they would in economy the food is the same which means rather bad and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight predictably the plane landed in hong kong just in time below three hours delay for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on th june but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers although this time the flight was on time this gave me such a bad feeling about ba their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness i will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba 
1487, belfast to munich via heathrow today th july i found i needed to change a travel date from th july to th july i attempted to do this on ba s manage my booking for about hours and although i selected different flight times each time i thought my booking change was completed at an extra cost of seat costs i was told that my changed flights were fully booked even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available quite a few so i contacted ba s customer services by phone and waited for about minutes for an agent who after saying hello and providing his name promptly lost me so another minutes later i spoke to another very caring and helpful ba agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost onto my ticket i could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less i am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by ba when all the work is by me and on line and ba can re sell my friday flight the time i spent going around in circles online to end up with nothing and having to phone customer services and the time it takes to get though to customer services who clearly are insufficiently staffed over worked and with limited capacity to really help ba you are in serious need of a makeover and self examination to have customers such as i consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this 
1488, london heathrow to tallinn return flight on time on way out had changed seats to row emergency loads of legroom and row in front can t recline so it was very comfortable bought a nondescript coffee good flight the flight home was a surprise using a qatar airways plane and crew due to ba strike row not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on ba a better seat on a new plane a decent free snack and a nice small bottle of wine also free so a good experience wake up ba 
1489, london heathrow to barcelona i thought it would be better than a low cost airline but it is not in fact it is quite worse so if you have a cheaper option do not hesitate to go with them the flight is full and they say you can only take on board a backpack to put under your seat but not the bag trolley rude people and ridiculous rules a company living in the past century 
1490, dubrovnik to gatwick poor ground service chaotic boarding via airport bus no greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff the shoddy service which has become the ba norm forced to fly ba by tour operator would other wise have chosen a alternative airline most food choices for purchase were not available tea was lukewarm and not pleasant cabin staff rude and unhelpful a most unpleasant flight 
1491, stockholm to london heathrow shabby third party lounge in stockholm very tired aircraft buy on board service took ages crew were funny raising an eyebrow at ba s new low cost carrier concept in europe with the expensive buy a sandwich on board ba are one rung about ryanair and on par with easyjet when it comes to customer service and delivery such a shame what s happened to them convenient flight times and lhr departure is as good at it gets i m afraid 
1492, london to dubrovnik interesting that ba have dropped the to fly to serve advert boarding was the usual unorganised shambles selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads no less than three couples came on with oversized bags in one instance it took people to lift a bag into the overheads coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers when complaints were made to cabin crew the response was they are entitled to bring hand luggage the trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time most of the choices were unavailable cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system would strongly recommend taking own food on ba short haul flights 
1493, flew accra to london heathrow all was going well which in accra means an orderly boarding got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load i assume more loaded than was on the manifest the takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job this then took an hour to sort out with cargo being removed no drinks offered this was business class i reminded myself once off the flight was the standard british airways club world product nothing special or memorable but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen tired business class product old and tired plane i wish ba would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you would use in a bathroom the crew don t really have much to offer now in terms of product although they were professional if not friendly must be terrible working for ba now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers the inflight entertainment is dire for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films with the rest of the chose the same month after month the memento of this night flight has not changed for years it is surely due a refresh 
1494, london heathrow to stockholm newish aircraft nice leather seats but very cramped nice leather seats had emergency exit which was fine but others were very tight ba is now akin to a low cost carrier in europe don t expect much and you wont be disappointed really is no different to flying easyjet these days 
1495, malta to gatwick this is for british airways catering service managers they have invested a lot of time and money into your meal scheme so as to earn extra income rather than give free meals initially i was very impressed when i spied the m s food and drink menu which does merit appreciation however on flight ba from malta to gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted i am a strict vegetarian so i was happy to see the selection of vegetarian fayre but unfortunately by the time the trolley got to me a long time i might add there was no veggie sandwiches no veggie focaccia not even mixed nuts for heavens sake of course there was plenty for the non vegetarians not only that but the couscous salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternative i was very disappointed and ba need to do better for me to fly with ba again i d need some assurances that they will care just as much for the veggie people as for the meatheads 
1496, london to zagreb british airways lost my luggage on the th june and here i am on the th still trying to get some information we came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we weren t providing the correct information when we asked him what information was incorrect he would not proceed with our call on the th day when we were back at the airport to fly out we were told that the bag was delivered to our temporary address the day before what a mess we were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us when we arrived at heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage if you make a claim you need to just wait for a phone call i never heard from anyone we are back home now in australia and i have just called to follow up the bag to which i was advised that the claim has been closed now i need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another hrs to get an update not once have we received a call from anyone our phone bill is over aus due to the amount of calls we had to make i suggest british airways take a good hard look at how you treat your customers who spend a hell of a lot of money to fly with your airline and take in to some consideration how you would feel being on the other side of the world with no luggage for days absolutely disgraceful 
1497, manchester to philadelphia i booked my flights through british airways but the flights were american airlines i booked a gluten free meal both ways using the field in the booking form that ba had provided when the meals came round i was told that ba had not passed on my dietary requirements and all they could offer me was a small salad half a tomato and some lettuce when i landed i emailed british airways to complain and ask them to ensure i had a gluten free meal on my return i received no reply and again there was no food for me on the flight after countless emails i finally received a message telling me that even though british airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements i should have contacted american airlines to request it british airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines i told them that they shouldn t ask for information that they don t intent to pass on but was met with the same you should have requested it better line they are truly incompetent at one point they started talking about my child which i don t have for customer service 
1498, just landed from the second of two flights in first between london and kuala lumpur and on both legs the experience was exceptional chose seats e and f on both legs for my partner and i and seats were clean well maintained fully functioning and very comfortable ground service at t is a vast improvement with the new first wing passed through quickly and met by attentive staff with prompt and professional service in the concorde room golden lounge at kuala lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu onboard the staff on both legs were professional friendly intuitive attentive and good natured and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests flowers in the bathroom which was kept clean though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times and amuse bouche provided plenty of wine no shortage of food and nothing ran out my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask these flights reminded of why we fly with ba and remain loyal to them 
1499, frankfurt to london heathrow three bags belonging to self and colleague checked june at frankfurt on the flight to london hrs before flight flight arrived in london mins late and of bags appeared on carousel a business flight with virtually no checked baggage on it courteous customer service personnel in baggage hall took details noted that baggage had not been loaded promised that bags would be sent on first flight the next day and should be delivered to our office by noon nothing and still waiting for delivery at three days later how and why out of delivered and why hours for delivery 
1500, british airways business class heathrow to accra as the bbc reported the most delay afflicted route out of or of flights on this route were delayed by over minutes last summer as a regular on this route i can verify these unacceptable delays indeed my flight the delay was as usual over an hour the club world product is now very tired and worn no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers the ba crew were fine but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines usual chaotic boarding process for this flight the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure it will never work on this routing when will ba learn the seating in the usual ba format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines including one world members like qatar american or royal jordanian the constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service the comfort is now more akin to ethiopian airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of ba the lhr acc lhr route is a money maker for ba they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth air france and klm probably offer a better business class service on this route a great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard 
1501, london heathrow to seattle i haven t even taken this flight yet and i am totally disillusioned i have flown with british airways times out of manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight on this occasion i have decided to drive down to london heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike i telephoned ba customer service today to ask about the laptop situation after pressing many buttons i was informed all the lines are busy and cut off i will never book a flight with ba again even if this means i have a long layover or connection time this airline is a national disgrace and the british flag should be removed from the livery if i get on the flight i will let you know how it is 
1502, on the th june i travelled from mykonos to london heathrow on ba if british airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally we were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase all we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits this flight left around lunchtime and i would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat to add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation if there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with i have today received a telephone call from ba following my initial complaint which really served no purpose it was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn t help me a service which was very good before the cost cutting we fly to serve i somehow don t think so anymore easy jet ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles i cannot imagine flying with ba again 
1503, i was flying back from zurich to heathrow after a visit to see my son we arrived in time at the airport check in was quick and friendly but once we got through security the trauma of ba began a hour delay on the screen why didn t they tell us at check in yes they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of bas old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet no welcome the seats were hard and uncomfortable before taking off the captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door the door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty a strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying when the food service came i was asleep but my said they ignored her when we did arrive at heathrow t we ended up at the c gates so adding another minutes or so based on this i will no longer pick ba as a preference the brand once the favourite airline is no longer 
1504, rome to heathrow flight on the rd june delayed take off over hours due to technical fault minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support no refreshments provided the only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening he was the only one who cared ba support and service in rome was non existent after take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably i had to pay for a cup of tea despite a delay with no refreshments provided ba is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better service ba has lost the plot 
1505, chennai to london what a mistake i selected this route for a two reasons i wanted to try the new british airways in club class and the timing but i have nothing good to say about the whole thing the lounge at chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what i think should be standard in business class there is no direct aisle access for the window seats and if you re in the aisle seat you ll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat the layout is quite crazy the seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how ba have crammed them all in that s the issue i had the window seat and initially i found it ok but as it was a very long all daytime flight i had to dim the window and that s the point you can only dim them down there is no blind the sun still shines through ok i accept it s like looking through very dark sun glasses but it s not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds i understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the but this is a major error by boeing it was my second flight on a both were hour plus flights the earlier one i made was at night so no issue with the window blinds i ve not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft i find myself just as tired after a flight as i would be on any other aircraft i m a long term supporter of ba and i m so upset that ba are going backwards focusing on profits and ripping off the customer sorry ba but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money because it won t last people like me will move on 
1506, flew london gatwick to genoa with british airways fast check in at the smart new premium area at gatwick brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food drink and magazines access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal i realize that nothing can be done about that the gate number was only announced minutes prior to the gate closing and it was minutes away at at fast pace especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators on board our club europe seats that we had paid extra to choose something that no other airline that i know of does with a full business class fare was behind the curtain overhead bins were full so ourselves and another club europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance an engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows and with our seats being in row my special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight leg room was atrocious for business class and seats are the same as economy because the curtain could not be drawn the business class toilet was used by economy class passengers and at times business passengers had to queue behind them given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great had to wait for about minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at genoa airport in all this was not a business class quality flight we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price 
1507, flew british airways from beijing to london heathrow the cabin crew did their best but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers cut backs are evident everywhere from the small and very cheap hot towels offered only once during the ten hours flight and the nuts presented in a packet other than with other airlines on china and warm this might seem a small niggle but it is indication of ba saves costs by annoying their premium cabin customer the amenity kits presented in a shoe bag is a joke really to be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other one world members royal jordanian and qatar for example flight left and arrived on time but the airline should be more than that the offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground was presented at the second meal serice with frozen pawns on bread returned and a de frosted plate came by return unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea but no effect as yet part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight i covered it up with a spare blanket despite there being enough toilets for club world passengers there was often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus snaking past seat in rows and no control of passengers from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself lovely shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels 
1508, flew british airways from corfu to london heathrow food service a joke i have never written a review on anything in my life but how can an airline like british airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed how many quangos to come up with this decision that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense apart from that flight great but sorry ba please admit your mistake and put this right 
1509, heathrow to santorini we were at the gate when ba cancelled our flight we could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage it took them days to return it ba will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at or the cost of the hotel at this is a total disgrace how can they be allowed to do that book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous 
1510, leeds to durban via london johannesburg check in at leeds was efficient security was slow so fast track was appreciated boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food transfer at heathrow was a breeze surprisingly with no further security check boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck with a pleasant greeting from the crew the premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom the seats are comfortable but both our seats were faulty mine would not stay upright and my wife s would not recline unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning we were moved to business class we should have reported it immediately sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings bar service followed quickly after take off but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy we both ordered beef fillet for dinner alternative was chicken which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created the a is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep there were several drink runs during the night and the cabin crew were quite active arrival was on time and everything went smoothly the final connection to durban with ba franchise comair was a reminder of the difference between flying in south africa and flying in europe more space and full service on a one hour flight 
1511, i had an early morning flight from london heathrow to dublin to attend a memorial service in ireland the check in process seems to have been automated and i am not impressed i saw an elderly chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in ba uniform walked away and ignored them i intervened and assisted the interior of the aircraft was spotless however there was no catering per se other than a to buy marks and spencer items no cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed the cabin crew were lovely people and deserve better than to have the name of a once proud national carrier reduced to such a miserly product arrival was punctual 
1512, bangkok to luxembourg via london premium economy on british airways is disappointing the bangkok to london route is served by b aircraft that look like they ve seen better days boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights seats are old and worn not very wide and with little recline the ife is poor in terms of choice the screens are the smallest i ve ever seen and the sound quality is very bad the food served is ok service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline the short haul flights between london and luxembourg in economy were good it s time for british airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading asian middle eastern airlines or even the better european ones 
1513, london heathrow to paris orly i have been a gold member of ba over years making approx flights per year we have been through ash clouds strikes it breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace i didnt think it could get worse but it did arrived at the airport and my app said on time screens said on time but my independent tracking app said hours delay in the first class lounge i was told short delay knowing how inaccurate ba can be i asked to speak to special services one hour later i asked again i got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty take it up with alex cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity unimportant is how i felt after years of gold guest list she then told me the flight was cancelled and said i would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for charles de gaulle no alternative was offered i had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg ba for a refund which they tried to sidestep the moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at ba it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the ceo the other interesting fact is i did look at choices before booking including easy jet pounds air france pounds and foolishly i felt loyalty meant something not at this airlin the salt in the wound is that easyjet and af got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in france it is incredible that one airline who carry s the british flag is such a disgrace i am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak what has happened to ba and we wont fly them again 
1514, flew new york jfk to copenhagen via heathrow have flown premium economy pe on cathay singapore lufthansa and air france by far british airways is the worst world traveler plus just means plus everything else is downhill seats were cramped recline only a few millimeters food awful sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served amenities practically non existent and wrapped in cellophane tube of toothpaste if only the cap would open could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth no covers for the headphones totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word premium economy before i forget the boarding service was confusing calling colors gold silver sapphire etc people just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice screaming for order why not just call the way you sell first biz premium economy trying too hard to be fancy 
1515, flew london to hamburg i cannot believe that an airline like british airways have to compete with the likes of ryanair and easyjet and stopped complimentary cabin services no drinks no snacks they should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines i am now cofused why i should ever fly british airways vs low cost airlines i was recently also flying on club world my luggage was tagged priority but waited on arrival for over mins non priority bags came out mixed with priority british airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it s losing its edge as a world reknowned airline 
1516, british airways charges a big premium for premium economy i sat on the top floor of the a after being upgraded from world traveller at the gate and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from singapore to london heathrow there were two dinner options chicken tikka or beef fillet but as i dozed off i missed out so no food until hour before landing hours later unless i wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card i kindly asked for some water got some orange juice too didn t want to push it even though i saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley not worth the risk of a bad reaction i cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge the staff mean well however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an singapore airlines qatar cathay etc it s not cultural it s just indifference will continue to book ba for cheap economy product service offers almost no difference and enjoy upgrades where given 
1517, singapore to london i have started to take british airways as it s a corporate requirement the business class club world is more like premium economy the seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window you are basically trapped inside and you d have to disturb the other passenger to get out furthermore the bed does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift fold down stool if you apply too much pressure on that stool it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch it s just flimsy the food is very low quality and tatstes bland i have already tried the regular meal and special meals don t bother the service is poor with a crew that is not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers overall i am very disappointed 
1518, this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by mixed fleet easy check in at toronto pearson the ba ground staff are always great in toronto with fast track meant i was in the lounge mins after arriving at the airport the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited average wine list still too few bathrooms the seats are tatty and when busy is not a relaxing place to be easy boarding and the first of a few improvements prosecco now served to london used to be only ex london fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer an ok chicken curry was served but i still don t see it as biz class food a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each that is where the improvements ended the morning offering of a cereal bar and t cs juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience the crew on this flight were great young junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi but appeared in glass without asking as soon as the crew were released classy and well remembered the return flight was less good drinks served promptly after take off and my pre booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray crew member s first flight since qualifying it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and t c customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back really as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after hours i need something more substantial than chocolate service reduced yes price reduced no the s in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp the ife screens are tiny mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort however the male crew were more aloof lacked attention to detail and officious what these newer crews miss was the more informal laid back service of long haul crew i hope they relax into the role soon at least the cuts have stopped not much left to cut i admit and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened however the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world it really depends on what ba do next to either value me as a customer and offer a quality service or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline at which point i m off 
1519, i arrived at london heathrow in transit with a british airways flight on to another ba flight the aircraft was there still boarding my bag was checked in for my final destination but i wasn t they forgot to check me in for my full journey at departure they didn t let me board and made me stay overnight i have never seen such level of stupidity bad management and poor service 
1520, the crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from johannesburg to london were very young unprofessional and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the british airways crews special and outstanding they were basically on both flights rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next hours before the breakfast service on both flights there was no water offered during the night which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium the meals were overcooked and on both flights the knives could not cut through the best of british beef given that the hot meals are the same than in club according to ba s marketing i would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in business class a perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when i got up after dinner and went to the galley as nobody cared to answer the bell and asked for a baileys the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a baileys was and the answer came sorry sir we don t have that kind of wine would you like some white i am missing the good old ba and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future even if it means paying a few hundreds more 
1521, flew valencia to london gatwick with british airways check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay security was a bit slow no fast track business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor note this is not a ba lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner boarding was a disaster we were called to board but then waited on the air bridge for over minutes the air bridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no ac or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy there was no communication from the ground staff which although not ba staff reflects badly on the airline once we were finally on board the flight was trouble free good service hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant plane arrived only minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control would have been a nice trip back bar the problems in valencia airport 
1522, london heathrow to edinburgh return possibly my last ba flights i used economy or maybe should be re named economy minus outbound and returned in club europe checked in online however of the checking in kiosks were not working at t so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk security quick i m a ba oneworld sapphire member so used the north lounge which was okay flight boarded on time but departed min late and arrived min late a seat a an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board return check in quick as was security the ba lounge in edi has been the same for a few years now it s at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff boarding through gate on to a pretty old departed min late club europe on domestic flights is a new introduction actually it replaced what was ba economy class a cynical ploy by the ba board to extract more money out of its loyal customers the aircraft was pretty full so some people like ba although i suspect many passengers were transferring at lhr service was okay food economy standard although included in the price arrival at t around min late min for bags i fly between times each year on long haul flights i have supported ba in the past although i ve not used them long haul for about months basically they are not good enough cut backs and poor service is evident i expect security comfort and some service when paying for a business class ticket qatar cathay and even srilankan offer better service on reflection i fly business class on most flights so i don t actually need any frequent flyer status the cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits i might fly ba in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles i ve earned but my loyalty will be my wallet in future bye ba 
1523, london to valencia in an a in club europe this was the first time we had flown british airways since the move to the south terminal check in was quick and progress through security also without delay ba lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available refreshments in the lounge ok but nothing special boarding on time cabin crew in club europe were very pleasant and efficient as i always find with ba meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter thyme roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne note ba no longer use miniature bottle and pour as required from proper sized bottles cheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were soft plane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didn t work and our cases was about the last through overall a good flight 
1524, brussels to rome via london there are no substantial differences to the service offered by a low cost airline no free food beverage little leg space choice of seets only for extra payment etc however the price i paid was at a low cost level as well so the value for money is ok 
1525, awful cost cutting beyond belief dirty aircraft uncomfortable seats inflight entertainment is something that would have existed in the s has been the same for several years no meal choice meat either one meat or veg half empty cabin across the entire flight ran out of alcohol too ba have and are continuing to cost cut but they haven t cut their prices to reflect this i would seriously fly someone else enough is enough you ve had my years of loyalty silver exec club member or not i m off and will advise others to do the same i cannot give a out of the is purely for the cabin crew who are embarrassed by what is now budget airways 
1526, london heathrow to madrid an absolute third world experience once i got on the plane check in and lounge experience were great but once i got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the aircraft are there were seats with missing backs and do not occupy covers in front and beside them random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead and grimy yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior you have to worry about what s going on the important bits like the engines if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin the crew spent as much time as they could in the galley and interacted with passengers as little as possible the breakfast service was a salt infused hot cooked offering and just one run of drinks anything else you wanted you had to use the call button the one and only reason i booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing i d bought 
1527, gatwick to alicante my wife my son and me all flew ba euro club on our way to alicante for some reason when booking club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer my son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before the staff at ba were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch club euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom
1528, gatwick to antigua a frequent flyer with ba for over years silver exec club i have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past months alex cruz take over my partner and i fly regularly in eco prem and club depending on prices so have seen the decline across all classes recent trip to antigua from lgw was awful a pretty empty cabin filthy isn t the word awful in flight entertainment rockwell that hasn t changed in years easily food choice is no longer a choice its a meat dish or veg alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin lgw for both legs so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously hours into flight there was no spirits left bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service hours in to the flight ba state in their motto to fly to serve yes they certainly are flying but most certainly not serving the cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done they have cheapened the brand of the national carrier but haven t cheapened their prices easyjet and ryanair offer superior and on long haul its got to the point i will now fly virgin and others again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight stop trying to make ba budget we want it back to how it used to be all i can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major it glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in british airways 
1529, london city to milan the price of the ticket about for a hour flight had no relationship to the ultra economy service on this flight the aircraft was very dirty i wonder whether ba pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines don t seem to have filthy aircraft in business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for there is no place to power devices and forget wifi or overhead screens in business the food was an awful english breakfast no better than economy the embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take away to try and make up for the no frills service it feels chronic under investment for years has left this a bare bones airline milking short term profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for year 
1530, flown economy premium boston london heathrow geneva again as too often with british airways nowadays flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem as a consequence our connecting flight in lhr was missed had to wait for hours at lhr although there were earlier flights since our late arrival was known by ba at least hours in advance why didn t they at least pre book our connecting flight from lhr long queues at rebooking desk very little care of customers then again flight from lhr left late breakfast on board long haul miserable service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights although i have been travelling with ba for years with silver and gold status i will avoid flying with ba again and for sure let know around me that this airline is even not a shadow of what it used to be 
1531, gatwick to bordeaux awful newish a cramped seats the new buy onboard from m s does not work it takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin with some people not even getting served at least easyjet and ryanair have this down to a tee and serve promptly ba has gone downhill and nothing but sad customers and embarrassed cabin crew ba certainly isn t cutting prices of flights ryanair and easyjet offer many similar routes with half the price as ba i know where i will be taking my custom in future 
1532, london to boston return in premium economy another very disappointing flight experience with ba overall a low cost experience at a premium price baggage drop in t is now self service unless you fly business or first which feels like easyjet lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited the plane was a year old b which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration the screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited the cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions food was not edible i tried the beef option but could not eat it what i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at ba they have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back i am taking my business elsewhere and only use ba to spent the avios 
1533, istanbul to london on a reasonably priced airfare check in experience was quite good with friendly staff member at istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from me departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passenger s bag manually on board was average to say the least in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on british airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink nice products but very overpriced also there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent the seats on the a were also quite hard and uncomfortable the whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route who have wifi on many flights food and drink ife the experience was more like a low cost carrier i don t think i ll bother to fly them again unless i have to 
1534, london to mumbai terrible customer service i have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days and they keep blaming the travel agent even through the ticket was issued by ba after the meltdown on the th if you get through to their india call center you might as welll hang up the phone as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party will inturpt you when you are trying to speak just awful service agree british airways is going downhill been a silver member for many years need to look for another provider just awful customer service which ba won t care to look into 
1535, i am a frequent flyer with british airways having held silver membership for years on this instance i flew ba s short haul business class while you re essentially in the same cabin as everyone else you should get a meal onboard something i had counted on and the seat next to you should be left empty i fly this route around once every other week but have been ba to long haul destinations hong kong beijing nyc d c and san francisco several times a year my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights i have taken this year on the same and other routes the aircraft came in late which is a common occurrence with ba these days except for me nobody in business class had an empty seat next to them we were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered although we might be able to obtain food vouchers once we get to lcy in short the product was exactly the same as economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket this was complemented by slow and unfriendly check in staff an old aircraft and a good hour i had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested ba customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through on the whole a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that ba is very much going in the wrong direction they might be cheap but can t and shouldn t compete with low cost carriers or indeed asian airlines that have lower overhead costs 
1536, my wife and i were very disappointed with our british airways flights from sydney to london return flying premium economy the food quality cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as air new zealand and qantas that we have used there are no toilets allocated for the cabin and are located at the middle of the economy cabin quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them the seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones ba don t offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines we would not fly with ba premium economy again it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare 
1537, london to hong kong on a very new b er i was upgraded to wt at the gate owing to a full flight and probably being an emerald with oneworld i can now distil the difference in service product with economy on the same route with wt you will receive one amenity pack eyeshades socks toothbrush one welcome drink cava or water one glass for drinking with the first meal a slightly wider seat inch minor extra recline inch and a little extra legroom as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner i am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian which was the traditional ba carby pasta from wt which was fine i enjoyed the ife the crew were nice and the flight on time i wouldn t pay a premium of more than for the wt experience for this flight or other wt routes as a service it s not really premium economy in fact it s inferior to economy offered by star carriers 
1538, london to dubai good crew everything else terrible caught up in the shambles of ba it system collapse on th may so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day ba staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management flight itself next day crew excellent but the ancient not so with faulty ife food ok seat comfy but had seen better days and needed re upholstering was told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of heathrow from the day before luggage finally turned up wednesday days late compensation claim into ba rather a lot hopefully all gets paid ba have had a number of it failures past months simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers emirates on this route for a couple of years until i know ba has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive shame really ba used to stand for something and its now gone to the dogs 
1539, london heathrow to vancouver i am very disappointed by ba s gradual decline today i flew in the upper deck of the a ba s business class seats once the best in the industry are almost the worst the pods are abreast in the upper deck and very narrow this is an unpleasant aircraft with toilets to share between passengers in business class i think that s a poor ratio the flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly though i noticed no acknowledgement for being a gold card holder but their interest waned as the flight progressed it took hours to get a drink and almost hours from take off before the main course was served the beef was cold as were the vegetables it was actually inedible i suspect it had just been left out after dinner we were half way through our hour flight and i was never offered another drink i gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight british airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines i have flown recently this is a great shame the cabin is bad the food is awful the flight attendants unpleasant and ife ok 
1540, i took a long daytime flight from tokyo to london about hours the boeing seemed fairly new and was clean and the premium economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight with good recline although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space the catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting lunch was a small portion of very tough beef accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen there was then nothing for nine hours no snacks available anymore until a second hot meal of a small chicken curry was served shortly before landing a choice of drinks was offered only once shortly after takeoff during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice but nothing else was offered the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else i asked for more water but the crew said they didn t have any by the time we landed i was hungry and thirsty and i would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink the crew were invisible for most of the flight the ife system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines overall not recommended 
1541, british airways were truly awful on this flight from heathrow to miami very old tired aircraft these old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit seat back screens unbelievably small what shocked me most is just how much ba have cut back on their food service no bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option the chicken breast i received was laughable i have seen bigger chicken nuggets this came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll the only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for afternoon tea with a miniscule scone my advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley unfortunately ba have now become a long haul ryanair scrimping on every little thing not good 
1542, we flew out of terminal on saturday with british airways to brussels and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures we got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them we used the lounges as we have a silver card and they were busy but well staffed and the food was good on the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn t fancy the marks and spencer prices i bought a bottle of water close to our gate and thought that was expensive enough but the ba on board water was per bottle i did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water like many i can t get used to this budget airways approach it s clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good on our return we had big delays due to the storms in southern england and air traffic restrictions then we had brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure at all times the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to london and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up this delay was not ba s fault and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient i enjoyed the flight but hope that ba do not make any further cuts and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day 
1543, british airways seems to be going from bad to worse on my london heathrow to lisbon flight the card machine didn t accept american credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldn t pay for his drink the length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren t offered anything to eat or drink until minutes to landing the flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for ba return flight was delayed by mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline they are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices 
1544, booked gatwick to lima return out world traveller premium economy which was not too bad return club world was appalling seats and surround grubby equipment maintenance poor service was appalling staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted expected us to know how to operate equipment food thrust at us not served everything rushed no politeness in service drink choice not outlined just what do you want if it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of money it is so sad that ba is going to the dogs a business is nothing without customers and ba are doing a great job at alienating them i will not fly ba long haul again 
1545, london to johannesburg after getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend it fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by ba i approached my flight back to the uk with some trepidation my fears were not unfounded as the aircraft had been sitting at jnb for most of the day there were no delays and boarding started very early i was seat a top deck double seat and the leg room was no better than you would find on a ryanair flight to dublin indeed due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat it was a little more cramped the service on ba flights really is terrible i along with many other passengers was treated like an inconvenience and i felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren t there i was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due in part to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff i will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future 
1546, washington to sofia via london flying world traveller plus premium economy to london and eurotraveller economy on the short hop top quality service whatever may have declined in economy class premium economy is as good as ever with in leg room and meals really tasty in this instance that can be ordered in advance the cabin crew are still the ba strength creating a relaxed congenial atmosphere in the cabin smooth connections at terminal with no waiting either way and tribute cornish ale available on the long haul drinks menu and service is a winner i ll admit the m s food drink service can be a bit time consuming as far as handling the payments but works ok otherwise british airways continue to deliver a first rate travel experience and i m sticking with them 
1547, edinburgh to rome via heathrow i have been either ba gold or silver for many years the last years i was in texas but ensured my return to uk that flights were always ba and the same for my family who visited in july i returned to uk for business and had to stay until jul th i was points off retaining get gold if i had flown back on july i would have retained gold i had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem however i was duly downgraded to silver i then booked a holiday in rome for my wife and myself and i was amazed that ba have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea if ba wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine they have in the past left me stranded in moscow for days when snow closed heathrow yet bmi were still flying into heathrow i have encountered rude staff on check in long queues even for executive members they are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a star airline and should lose that status i will in future fly brussels airlines and lufthansa or internal uk easyjet they are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews if ba wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one
1548, rome to heathrow having used ba business club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday it s been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from rome was the decider the cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats no nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now there was a choice of meals but you weren t told unless you asked the meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline the advantages of booking club have gone the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks the priority labels mean you bags come off last and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue add to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security it should not be allowed to carry our national flag 
1549, it was the fist time i traveled with british airways and i believe it will be the last i had to reschedule my flight from tampa to tirana via gatwick from december to march first i couldn t change it online as the manage your flight option didn t work they told me it happens some times and i tried it a lot of times before contacting them so i had to pay for changing it via phone they took the money even though it wasn t my fault i made more than calls from november to a day before traveling to reissuing my e ticket after a long wait to get connected they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e ticket and sent it to my e mail for nearly months it never come until day before the flight every time i called they said they didn t have my cvv which i re confirmed every time when asked when will i get the ticket they said after days which only came on th of march and i was to travel on th once they nearly set me to fly to charlotte nc while confirming my data and cvv during one of the calls i made besides this the food was ridiculous but never mind that the anxiety time consumed and the distress they caused can t be either bought or excused how can a consolidated serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible unconcerned for the customer not complying to the minimum standards i expected soo much from them it was a total disappointment 
1550, chicago to london heathrow on british airways much vaunted sleeper service in business class be advised this service is a joke never mind the terrible dated seats facing one another but the ba sleeper service mandates you eat in their awful biz class lounge at ord and then suffer no dinner service on the plane this is a monumental con also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you get in the ba lounge at ord the food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog i used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans atlantic airlines the british airways business class product is the worst by far old aircraft old seats disillusioned crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable british airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt what happened to english class and manners 
1551, gatwick to funchal british airways has won the race to the bottom leg room on this flight was appalling worse than ryanair i can understand why no free food on short hops but this flight was four hours i wonder just what we gained from a full service airline our previous british airways flight was on a gatwick they are adding an extra seats to these planes with the recent it debacle they have reached the bottom and don t need to do anything else 
1552, i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were limited to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who was the last to be served was told what was available rather than asked what he would like this is in spite of there being only passengers in the seat cabin for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served the presentation of the food that was available was poor certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic confirmed that there has been cost cutting apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness complaints from passengers the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone other cost cutting around on board service is very evident even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become i fly regularly long haul with klm their new business class offering is now far superior to ba s first how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on may almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probably due to more administrative cost cutting i should add that the ground service at heathrow t the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril 
1553, absolute cheapskates business class flight in club europe from luxembourg to london heathrow is beyond a joke and clearly on a shoe string budget no pre meal drink offered limited selection of drinks with wine served in plastic screw top mini bottles warm with no nuts nibbles meal selection consisted of a chicken salad prawn which looked reasonably nice however i m allergic to seafood or a toasted cheese roll the roll was dry tasteless and completely unsatisfactory could have easily bought something better at greggs crew could clearly be heard bad mouthing their ceo over the airlines recent it problems friendly crew though can t help but feel sorry for them 
1554, geneva to dallas via heathrow i checked online and confirmed i had two bags of allowance to check in with my premium economy seat purchased however when i went to the airport to check in the luggage ba insisted that i only had one bag allowance and i had to pay i had no other choice so i paid i checked with ba in heathrow and they confirmed i had two bags now i will have to go through sending the customer service a letter to get a refund not happy that their system is not in coordinance with each other 
1555, choose a budget airline the magic of our national carrier has gone we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it s on par or lower than other low cost carriers firstly we didn t get any priority boarding with our two young children easyjet provides this secondly we reserved seats as travelling with our two children they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows on boarding we were told the plane has changed therefore we now had assigned seats thirdly after paying over for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo first class was out of bounds so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my year old grandmother and technology the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew cabin crew seats for landing the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing all minor points but they were the points we enjoyed with ba points that made us choose them small points that made the difference the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get i d rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline perhaps cost savings are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead for me their usp was their service without that there is no longer a point 
1556, london heathrow to seoul return i booked my return flights back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around london to seoul flight was very pleasant didn t get to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by minutes cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high quality menu choices the seat layout of with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a fold down seat step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully i m and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that i ve flown business class with before the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing months in korea in the days leading up to the flight ba s massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all with the flights on the th and th being cancelled completely luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take off was delayed by minutes i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing minutes earlier than scheduled however due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park this meant a delay of minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free this was time i could not afford to lose we eventually disembarked at which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim really wish i hadn t as it still took minutes for the bags to come off the plane by the time i had done all this and gone through arrivals it was and the gate was closing in mins talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the pm flight the next day wasn t at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay over when not on sale it really wasn t worth the hassle for me personally 
1557, los angeles to london british airways has one of the worst customer service you can find flight attendants were rude seat and food are ok but i find them worse than competitors flying this route they don t have wifi 
1558, flew british airways from heathrow to geneva cheapskate airline now only tap water available everything else needs credit card american family with hungry young boys couldn t buy anything for them as their machine wouldn t take us card return flight cancelled after hours on tarmac with the it crash staff brilliant including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could then ba ticket desk unmanned in geneva airport so queues just standing we were lucky to find swissair flight home or i think we d still be there 
1559, gatwick to lima return in business class no choice of seats until hr before the flight unless you paid extra i understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying pp per flight if you aren t is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz by the time we were able to check in there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together new ba lounge at lgw smart but packed out at the start of easter holidays limited food offering at breakfast no hot food at all unless you count lukewarm pastries fa service on flights in both directions was good though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services despite it being a day flight food and drink were fine but nothing special some choices not available by the time they got to us seating layout of in business class is very cramped especially if the flight is full the highest density seating i ve ever experienced in business and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open small drawer at your feet recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you re travelling solo no legs to climb over lie flat seat was comfortable though for a short person ife was poor compared to competitors hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available on the way home we didn t mind a long layover at lim as we thought we could use the lounge no such luck we couldn t be checked in all the way through from lpb so had to pick up luggage go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before ba staff appeared to check in the flight home only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger haven t travelled long haul with ba for several years and can only describe it as a functional value service even in business though it s not cheap i d only use ba again if they were the most convenient by a long way as happened here for a direct flight from london or for a great price on short haul there s really no comparison to emirates long haul offering in business 
1560, london heathrow to santorini we flew with of our family to santorini the business class seats are a joke i am but i just could not move in the seats they are so tight we then learnt from the steward that it s a new configuration that hasn t gone down very well with customers this once great airline that s gone from the best to the worst in years and on european routes it s no more than a budget carrier money is the key driver for ba with customers very last on the list we all felt we had paid for a service we never received 
1561, london heathrow to bilbao i fly british airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure but recently they are beginning to slip my last flight was with two friends for our annual outing this year to bilbao cannot fault the staff or flight crew however the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid there is now no reason to use ba for short haul when there is a low cost alternative this cost cutting may well back fire probably initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently 
1562, madeira to london i was always of the belief that british airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but i realise now that they are no better than budget airlines in fact i have experienced far better service on easyjet we waited over hours to be offered a drink and i ordered marks spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for hours on top of that there were just toilets for people while business class customers enjoyed toilets between of them of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took they make it very clear that economy class is just that but its shame the price doesn t match the standard of service all in all a very disappointing experience and i will certainly think twice about choosing ba in future 
1563, edinburgh to gatwick booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight schedule this was my first time flying with ba and probably my last if i have other option it didn t feel like a national carrier felt more like budget airline with no snacks drinks and fare class that doesn t include checked baggage flight was smooth enough efficient but boarded mins late in edinburgh no service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee 
1564, rome to london thursday may flight scheduled to leave at delayed due to technical issues for hrs and then cancelled at this caused missed connecting flight to los angeles very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants no one took charge of our situation information filtered through italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from iberia airlines ba staff was gone after pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel no one from ba was seen or heard from at hotel multiple calls by passengers to ba resulted in little to no assistance friday may passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at ba counter after hour in line i obtain a boarding pass on a flight to london with connection to los angeles however the ba desk attendant informs me that the flight out of rome is late due to technical issues and i will once again miss the flight out to la i m appalled at the lack of educated experienced ba assistance ba abandoned us at rome airport in addition there web site is of no help flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact 
1565, kuala lumpur to london very different from the flight over it s all about the crew and how they perform or how serious they take their job one crew was rude and when asked could i have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to chat to his fellow workers the food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink all male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when called it s a shame when you see ba trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or the airline 
1566, great flight from london to kuala lumpur on the boeing the crew were amazing and friendly and couldn t have done enough the food served was of good standard and we were asked a few times if we would like more drinks one crew member who said she had been with ba for many years was professional and excellent at her job 
1567, london heathrow to miami i was looking forward to this flight it was saturday so no work the following day and k on the upper deck used to be such a treat i have read many reviews recently of ba falling behind the competition so my expectations were low but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience firstly i have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work i should have given my ba golden ticket to one of them but forgot however no matter how good the crew it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby the seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere not a nice start the aircraft was very very old a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum the ife didn t work properly amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality the toilets compared to aa were small unpleasant seat is not up to most business class standard food was awful and the club kitchen almost non existent these days i would choose aa or delta united virgin any day over ba it was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience 
1568, moscow domodedovo to houston via london heathrow roundtrip in economy class all the flights were full in economy with the exception of ba which was to full british airways flight attendents are cordial and professional there was a wide range of beverages served including complementary alcoholic beverages the standard in flight meals were not bad but not great either the hour flight between london and houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight the hour flight between london and moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight i was surprised by the leg room in economy i am not tall but at cm tall inches i was able to extend my legs fully under the seat in front of me this made these long flights bearable both flights offerred headphones blankets and pillows the cabin temperature on the flights to houston was cold i had to put on a light jacket the cabin temperature on the flight from london to moscow was too warm i was sweating when people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves you know it is warm the in flight entertainment screen on the b in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgraded i could feel the heat being emitted from the screen as well make sure that your luggage is below the weight limit heavy bags are an additional usd per bag 
1569, london heathrow to brussels disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshments snacks to be provided given this isn t a low carrier airline however ba have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service certainly on short haul flights 
1570, london heathrow to las vegas paid for extra legroom c as they show the wrong type of plane on my booking and there is no difference to any other seat you would get for free no refund given as it states it may be different aircraft used problem is this route has always used the same type of aircraft so it s basically a con 
1571, london heathrow to san francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the service all flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule online check in and baggage drop straightforward and without hassle food was excellent particularly on outbound flight my partner is vegetarian and we both opted for vegetarian hindu meal which proved to be delicious aircraft in good order and clean cabin crew particularly on way out were professional attentive and friendly inflight entertainment choice was generally good offering something for everyone the only criticism is that seat choice function is too expensive even for economy class british airways are being very greedy in this respect and their charges are way higher than other carriers this was generally a positive experience 
1572, london to reykjavik i can t really review this flight as british airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested i reduce a day family holiday to days ruined xmas i can review the total lack of customer service the contempt for customers all in all ba are not just the worst airline but the worst company i have dealt with my rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of ba 
1573, on this route from amsterdam to tokyo haneda via london heathrow we had the expected service onboard the first flight was slightly delayed but our transfer time was more then hours so that didn t cost any problem the cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to hnd when we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged at hnd japan airlines is the agent for british airways and as it cost time to explain everything their service was great they filed a report to ba and when we are back from the journey we should contact ba to claim the damage we did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated despite this damaged suitcase it was handled great that s what made the difference to me 
1574, antigua to gatwick check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient better than gatwick and although we had a slight delay at immigration we were soon airside the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn t use it it was dark when we were there they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa s etc the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food boarding was on time on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife s tv nearly falling off its mounting fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious push back and departure was exactly on time within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange unlike the flight out where there was a more relaxed atmosphere the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say i want you to go to sleep now and i don t want to here a sound out any of you until the morning now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc but at the end of the day or night they are working and are getting paid to do so in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers it would improve the flight considerably breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim our cases were waiting for us overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba 
1575, london heathrow to amsterdam schipol on ba landed at luggage did not arrive contacted ground agent they could not be less interested was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser as it was a sunday all shops at amsterdam were closed at pm so was not able to buy essentials like make up called the luggage call centre times the first time the agent put a note in the system to say that i needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day then received message on phone that the luggage would be on a flight arriving at subject to conditions called again to check if the luggage had left heathrow agent could not tell and rudely told me to wait called again at and finally got through agent said she would get someone to call me to let me know if it was possible for me to pick up the luggage at schipol no one called called the next day all the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be delivered message to ba management you can do better by having a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system by employing people who do care about your customers and forget about telling your customers that of people get their luggage back within hours for business travellers that offers zero comfort take a leaf off qatar airways one of your one world partners they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transit and qatar airways ground service staff show that they do care 
1576, i was pleasantly surprised with british airways on both outbound and inbound flights from orlando to gatwick after reading the reviews i would go as far as to say i would choose them over virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference the crew both ways were friendly and really helpful i have found virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest contrary to how virgin crew are on an overnight flight serve food dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing ba crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything we had nearly hour delay leaving orlando on g viiu firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go we returned to gate for paramedics top up of fuel etc and departed at versus throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable i can recommend d as there is no pax seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back for economy class leg room was good food was fairly decent for aircraft food only slight negative was the dated avod as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems 
1577, london to hong kong the avios system is now a complete joke they are impossible to spend they release a minuscule number of flights and won t allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability they ve just quoted me nearly to upgrade a flight this evening so i know there s availability but they won t let me use avios their concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrier more modern airlines with easy to use air miles booking systems like emirates deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline 
1578, flew premium economy from london to toronto in a boeing noisy aircraft third time on this plane and not impressed seamless use of boarding pass on my smart phone first time i have done this as well as self serve baggage drop flight good cabin crew pleasant food ok ish though nothing special back on a more comfortable and quieter than though still nowhere near a standards crew excellent food unexpectedly good the veggie lasagne was one of the best i ve ever had and the wine of a good quality luggage appeared promptly at both ends overall a good experience 
1579, mexico city to copenhagen via london it appears inflight service has improved a bit in club and the food is now edible and available in flight entertainment reminds one of the vhs days number of films available is rather limited timing with food was great served quickly after take off and again late before arrival made time for a good rest configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the dorset crab for lunch at fornum and mason in terminal ba refuses to credit qatar airways avios even when qatar airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited showing one level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket i have given up on avios 
1580, london to santiago de chile surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b is or looks far lighter and wider than any b i ve been travelling on could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the cocoon look less cramped even the seat looks wider while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution the odd ying yang layout is slightly better on boeing as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats therefore you won t share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there so first impression better than usual unfortunately the soft product remains way below par i pre ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available but the beef was overcooked and chewy i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous sort of a blue shoe bag too small to fit shoes though the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual overall the experience was better than usual mainly thanks to a newer quieter aircraft but ba is not improving where they should in those details that make business class something worth eur spent still no wi fi on ba not commenting the ying yang layout which remains a mystery to me who approved such a nonsense 
1581, gatwick to amsterdam as a regular flyer with ba my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image beyond that they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry they have no solution for the slightest problem we were scheduled to fly to amsterdam on the st of feb at there was a radar problem in amsterdam easyjet etc were informing their customers of development nobody informed anyone at the ba desk until it became a confusion at almost we were rescheduled to the flight with another further hours delay before this i have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the flight i now had two sets of ticket for same flight up to now getting a refund is a nightmare 
1582, how far ba has sunk flew london heathrow to nice and back last week surly and unfriendly cabin crew food and drinks for purchase does ba stand for budget airline now i never thought i d see the day when i would say ba has sunk to and below the levels of ryanair service yet still around x more expensive 
1583, i was very disappointed because on my flight from athens to london a hour flight no food or drinks were offered for free we even had to pay for water this was not a low price flight and everyone except business class had to buy any food or drinks very very disappointed as other european airlines provide free food and drink snacks even from countries such as greece aegean airlines will not choose ba again 
1584, i flew london heathrow to cape town to board the queen elizabeth cunard had included a flight via the middle east which at the time did not make sense so i paid the additional each to fly direct with ba the airline i knew and trusted for years the check in was smooth which encouraged me that i had made the right choice however on board the ageing boeing nothing else was worth talking about the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than i have previously had with ba the space available was tight for me an average sized man i don t know how a larger and or taller person would manage ba has lost two loyal customers but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain on my next long haul i will regretfully opt for an alternative airline 
1585, my wife and i flew british airways from london heathrow to berlin tegel in club europe this was a free avios upgrade having the middle seat blocked and a meal is the only onboard difference to economy we paid for seat selection which i would not have been wiling to do if i had paid the silly prices charged for these short flights good value if a free upgrade 
1586, british airways from rio de janeiro to london heathrow i booked premium economy to get more legroom as i am ft however this is non existent the crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her year old and i asked the crew to help with the situation they told me that it s the passenger s right to do whatever they want so no common sense there despite having other seats available in the business area they refused to move me even though they were seeing the issue i couldn t fit in my seat for a hour flight they even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy i had to pay extra pounds each way to reserve seats needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is stars this is not the ba that people once knew it s under iag and new leadership team that aim to cut expenses at any cost one of them being customer service avoid like the plague 
1587, london heathrow to edinburgh awful awful company my randomly allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats i m not too bothered about the lack of drinks meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles no cash payment option not enough stock etc etc on arrival back at heathrow t we were parked on a remote stand by t and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal the staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low ba had sunk how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape save your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be my advice 
1588, although they indicate it s against their policies they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow causing a min delay as a result we missed our connecting flight for all the other connections that were missed they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed however they did not announce any arrangement for out flight even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to check this is the second time in two years i had poor experience with british airways their service is consistently unacceptable 
1589, gatwick to antigua this was our first time in quite a while travelling from the south terminal and the first impression was that the ba check in area was a little cramped it was quite busy at the cw check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open we were through in about five minutes the fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge this is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views comfortable seats and reasonable food i had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll the departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time it didn t really matter we had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the hour check in as this would have cost up to for my wife and i depending where you wanted to sit however we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway after boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine which for a change was pleasantly chilled the staff were generally friendly especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch we had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just ok i ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland the interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience also the ife seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution afternoon tea was ok although no provision was made for my wife s sandwiches she is a vegetarian so we had to mix and match between the two of us we landed on time in antigua overall the flight was enjoyable without ever achieving any great heights pardon the pun and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience 
1590, berlin tegel to london heathrow in club europe business class a weekend evening flight that was quite empty i had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it was worth the extra had checked in online so no contact with ground staff and having arrived to berlin from beijing with a tight connection i did not bother to use the terraces lounge here knowing the lounge from previous visits the staff are okay a fair range of snacks and drinks but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilets boarding was quick only out of seats occupied in club cabin seats having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty captain very informative and they are ba s biggest asset for the details provided to customers a hot chicken sandwich cheese biscuits and chocolate mousse was served all to a good standard drinks of your choice from the bar and decent coffee to follow cabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient probably due to being a quiet saturday evening flight 
1591, these are words you may not read often but i actually enjoy the british airways flights from london city the staff are friendly and for now they still feed you and offer extra drinks after flying ba for several decades i have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the cost cutting but for short haul ba is my first choice out of city 
1592, flew manchester uk to billund denmark have flown with british airways for over years with work throughout northern europe compared to other airlines i ve used they by far in my view deliver better service all round staff are polite and friendly food is always tasty easy check in system at the airport efficient and very good value for money all round 
1593, travelled to bangkok recently for work tired old plane with vintage entertainment system drinks were served before dinner no nuts crisps available followed by a passable but small dinner as it was around uk time i pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself after a minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service incorrect drinks were then brought my colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait eventually the correct drink was brought i ve written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from british airways i ve flown ba a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it s disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going the company i was working for paid for the ticket so i don t know what it cost but don t imagine it was cheap in their defence i flew back with them from delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff 
1594, i am one of those crazy people who still until recently flew edinburgh london heathrow weekly paying nearly with british airways as it s the key airport now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight boarding for flight is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late holidays in madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for hrs i wrote to ba and got the big fob off add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane so game over for me and any trace of a relationship it s now tedious you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection 
1595, return trip for me and my wife using avios flying from london heathrow to miami staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors flights on time food and drink choices quality were decent but not on a par with some other carriers it s clear ba s cost cutting affects all cabins on the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers having said that i could have ordered in advance via the web site on the return leg it s worth noting that access to from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming so it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife we are both gold card holders from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend overall very enjoyable flights but not any better than some airlines business class 
1596, ba onboard british airways a for the gruelling hours from singapore to london heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers i d like to be biased to ba i m silver member and british and it s my national carrier but come on let s get to the chase this route is now also served by garuda and singapore and i can say ba are at the bottom of the list for the economy service seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest the pillows are wafer thin like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled together food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers chocolates and other things that you can snack on they close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines this also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn t refilled ba have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant polite and respectful but minimum effort on the plus movie selection is great and tv on the a is good but not in singapore airlines league your air miles earning for this route is more generous than garuda and singapore i would recommend premium economy if you can or if you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is rather than downstairs or alternatively try the competition which will soon include norwegian air and i can t see how norwegians economy class can be any worse than ba s 
1597, flew nice to london with british airways in economy won t bother again moving most of my travel to klm lh now where i can at least get a complimentary g t ba nice flight had minimal legroom only lavatory at the back with aisle blocked however by crew selling buy on board so low cost so over them 
1598, london to male i booked a flight for my wife to india but before paying for it i called the ba executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable they told me that it was less an administration charge i then had to cancel the booking and instead i booked a flight with ba to the maldives to my dismay i was not refunded what i expected for the fare to india instead they only refunded the taxes insurance etc for the cancelled booking i called ba at the beginning of march to find out what had happened they told me that they would get back to me within days two months later i called them again and was told that the refund department would call me this they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me back either the executive club of ba are lying or they are incompetent i was asked the time and date when i called ba but unfortunately i do not have it because i did not think it necessary to log the call it is obvious to me that ba do not honour their commitments and i will no longer fly with them i have been an executive member for years and this is how ba treat their customers an absolute disgrace 
1599, they abandon you on a return flight rude and aggressive customer service department both ba flights in the morning midday and the only flights to heathrow were delayed by up to hours no clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screen resulting in being stranded in rome airport with ba customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund let alone minimum of trying to help a client 
1600, keflavik to london heathrow this time i was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft i was travelling with two companions so i had to find the space for trolley cases i discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat and it belonged to a cabin crew it was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process ba on short haul is simply a budget airline and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage management i wasn t impressed by their on board service either they were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers even though they were complaint by other passengers 
1601, glasgow to chicago via heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to premium economy at an extra cost what a disappointment the aircraft was an old badly in need of a refit cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work this took until minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy in fact the economy section on the refitted on the return flight ba was better than the premium offer on outward leg to be honest ba had a cheek to charge for this supposed premium product this was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on virgin to make matters worse the ba customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort with no regards for keeping future business to be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier
1602, i have always given fair reviews to any airline with ba and being a gold emerald member i have lost my patience i have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error it has been days of this i have contacted ba through their twitter account to be told to call their bahrain call centre which of course does not work but have been told to call the indian centre times i have called at my own expense to get people with poor english have no idea how to manage the upgrade quote outrageous prices times the web price social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control it has got to the point like so many other reviews i will use the avios and move to qatar who appreciate their loyal customers my advice the ground as well at the air service is now budget 
1603, london heathrow to edinburgh almost hilarious had i not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position i was in row the first were business class i was the last to be offered food or a drink i had the sandwich and wine when i got home it would have been easier to buy the sandwich bigger choice at m s at edinburgh airport the budget airlines could show british airways how to do a proper operation the remaining or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink ba could not even be the acronym for budget airline absolutely useless 
1604, flew london heathrow to vienna wow who is running this company in over years of flying i ve never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as british airways has recently i can accept that i now have to pay extra if i want to check in a bag but to sit on a full service airline for over hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water really did i miss something have they lowered their prices no they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was and still is at their prices included in the fare ba now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we d almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who d ordered a hot sandwich but because the payment machine wasn t working they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without the atmosphere was pretty grim it s been a few years since i ve experienced such a miserable economy flight that was probably ryanair but they ve really raised their game british airways was a great carrier even a year or so back but now it s really overpriced rubbish and they don t make me feel welcome anymore there are so many other options in europe 
1605, we sat in j k which is a two seat row the aircraft is x x otherwise see seat review aircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staff the aircraft left mins early arrived mins ahead of schedule within one hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to aberdeen service was ok but things are not as they were with british airways food bland and unexciting drinks service limited breakfast was served way to late in the flight no major complaints toilets clean and functional inflight entertainment worked ok but the volume bud type headphones were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to follow picture was ok cabin crew were polite and did their job arrival at terminal c gates and passage to a gates was a breeze at hrs walked straight up to boarder control no one else in the line even security was very quiet 
1606, heathrow terminal to budapest in april busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers seated in row f which was the th row of economy class after taking off on time it took mins for the food trolley to travel rows service was an absolute shambles staff serving a full flight whilst other staff serve approximately people in business class instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the ipad payment machine instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel rows the senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only mins of flight time left british airways have really let themselves go downhill will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless they re the cheapest option 
1607, z rich to london heathrow as part of a days trip almost around the world my first leg from z rich to london was on british airways it turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience thanks to early online check in i managed to secure a bulkhead aisle seat i would have preferred a window seat though boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers after i settled down i approached her with my request she said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best after less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom so i stayed the rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism i brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering service was slow the new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly ba should reinstall the old system again the cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age the flight took off with a delay of minutes but was a the gate at terminal minutes before scheduled arrival time 
1608, dublin to london euros for the worst business class flight you can imagine business class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off outbound from dublin around lunchtime i was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing else i was told i had to order a kosher meal if i did not eat ham so i practically had nothing to eat the stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack however i was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight so i ordered a kosher meal for my return flight i got the kosher meal but it was vile some sort of salmon that was tasteless very poor experience ba should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier 
1609, flew british airways from london gatwick to orlando contrary to a lot of the other reviews i found the aircraft and staff on board to be fine sat in d on g viio seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of recline i agree the ife is not to the standard of other airlines but it was watchable and had a fairly decent amount of content on it the staff were all friendly attentive and helpful so no problems there inflight meals were the typical chicken or vegetarian option plus a sandwich was offered shortly before arrival 
1610, british airways from aberdeen to london heathrow the service was what you would expect from a budget carrier like easyjet or ryanair the only difference that the price was more expensive easyjet offer a service from aberdeen to london gatwick for around return this flight cost myself and my girlfriend each there were no complementary snacks offered we had to pay each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold the only reason we flew british airways was because we had a connecting flight from heathrow with another airline british airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the fees they have to pay at heathrow i don t buy it though our connecting flight from heathrow cost each and was a hour flight yet a hour and minute flight with ba costs each how does that work 
1611, london heathrow to toronto british airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations recently as the director i have been getting complaints about service cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff which i have listened to but have been too busy and really hadn t listened properly exactly what ba seems to do based on my personal experience this recent trip to toronto summed everything up for me firstly after paying around extra each for a premium economy seat for each of the three of us travelling unlike competitors ba does not provide priority boarding you line up with all the other economy passengers when on board you are met with smiling staff some immaculately dressed others who look as if they have had a bad night so who manages quality and standards premium economy offers a little more space than economy however that is about it service levels in the cabin are minimum food is unexceptional and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and a biscuit delivered with all the fanfare of a gold bar being delivered however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in premium economy was both palpable and vocal and staff could not have cared less other companies such as air canada offer a superior experience for the same price ba management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely familiarity definitely breeds contempt but ba really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products the marketing image does not match the reality ba ground service and management at toronto is appalling staff sitting around passengers bags missing delayed no one to help staff being openly rude and dismissive a thorough review is needed 
1612, london to boston amazing flight without a problem arriving on time despite a little late departure seat confort was great for economy back of seat was very good and leg space seemed above average seat confort on this a seemed better than emirates a crew was great available and with special attention to kids 
1613, newark to london heathrow you have to be very careful when choosing a flight to new york most of the jfk flights are years old boeing s prone to breaking down on the tarmac the new st is so cramped and i avoid any flight whenever possible i deliberately choose newark as it is served by a new boeing coming back we were on one with just seats in st class its not bad a bit better than the boeing but nowhere close to singapore airlines emirates etc the lounge is a shared one with cathay pacific its ok but apart from a st dining area st class passengers are bundled in with club passengers it is a nice set up though boarded on time and had dinner tasteless starter of prawns and fennel horrible soup chicken mains was ok wines ok the bed was made up and i slept for a few hours we were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule plane seemed pretty empty and club was very empty club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling as we walked through the cabin i was reminded how cramped and daft the ying yang seats are 
1614, london heathrow to newark we had heard a lot about the ba first class wing at lhr and after checking in we made our way through it directly from the check in area the security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the first of the ba st class lounges if you did not know about the more exclusive concorde lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge the first one was rammed end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place the concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area it was okay the lounge is long long overdue for a refurbishment the boeing was parked at the b terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly fa champagne was served and for once it was chilled the cabin looked a little tired and i suspect the plane was one of the first to have new first we had the new liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last december no amuse bouche and no flowers in the wcs there were nine passengers in first and with an average spend one way the total revenue would have been circa well done ba you saved for two bunch of flowers in the loos and x for the amuse bouche grand saving of the operating costs a massive lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus pizza express is better quality and my eyes popped as i read the lead appetizer and i quote loch fyne kinglas smoked salmon with oscietra caviar burford egg shallots creme fraiche and chive cress oh my goodness caviar my excitement was short lived i had caviar alright but just five eggs yes folks eggs not grams you had to laugh the soup was horrible the salad never arrived the main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed wine ok fas all fine we landed ahead of schedule and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot i did not feel the plane touch the tarmac 
1615, pisa to london gatwick started return flight in the shared lounge all very pleasant and not busy for once walked the tarmac to the plane as ba are too mean to pay for a skybridge anymore plane fairly new and a lot better than the old crate we flew out in took off on time we had the front row of the business class for once i had the meal as it looked nice it was a salmon salad and i have to say it was very good indeed my wife had a hot cheese sandwich which she said was ok champagne was served from the bottle it was nice we landed on time and closer to the terminal not bad for ba for once 
1616, heathrow to san francisco upper deck in economy great service friendly and efficient crew comfortable check in was very swift tend to not like the self check in and self bag tag but more and more airlines are going this way so have to accept it it was very quick so no problem there 
1617, berlin to london what an embarrassment our national carrier has become a laughing stock german passengers with us were amazed that all items of refreshment had to be purchased each transaction took a long while being paid by card two elderly male flight attendants were barely able to service a full flight within the time available the refreshments on offer were limited british airways used to epitomise service and quality it is now just like any other cheap carrier 
1618, london gatwick to pisa i fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the south terminal its not as user friendly as the north and meanders around up and down all over the place could also do with a refurbishment we approached the new ba lounge which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the terminal with reservations as everything ba does nowadays is cheap and skimpy pleasant surprise its pretty top notch good food and plenty of booze nice and airy with spacious seating we wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge all good so far then the flight was called and our new found love affair with ba quickly receded the walk to the gate was miles it took us minutes and needed a bit of a run as well arrived all nice and sweaty plane was busy and we had the front row the best seats usual disappointment with the lousy seats economy masquerading as business seats plane old and dirty the wc was disgusting dark and dingy and the bowl well i dare not even try and describe it here save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it leaving a permanent effect took off on time my wife had the sandwiches which she said was dry and tasteless i settled for a couple of gin and tonics you don t expect much nowadays from ba and therefore you are disappointed before you get a chance to be disappointed crew were fine and don t like the ba cost cuts as one said we spend half the flight apologising to passengers they also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon i did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and drink on board disgraceful 
1619, london heathrow to phoenix i have been flying with british airways for years although i haven t used them recently i was surprised at the service or lack of service our national carrier has turned into the worst the crew are nce and friendly so no real complaints apart from on a hour flight during the day they were nowhere to be seen until about hours before landing the food was absolutely appalling for dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian i had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless the chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea pur e this was the only thing edible on the plate a tiny beetroot salad the obligatory hard as rock bread roll for dessert a small piece of chocolate brownie complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn t realise they could ask for wine etc a small container of water was on the tray this meal was served about hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing at which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box a packet of crisp and popcorn all carbohydrates and a small container of water i tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard so i left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me then tea coffee was served i am not expecting a gourmet meal but there was no thought given to the food provided on british airways there was no fruit no salad or proper vegetables there were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water the flight entertainment did not exist a couple of new films the rest were old or unheard of the music radio audio was the same with no new music or unheard of artists my daughter booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the us i have asked her not to book me on british airways again i would rather travel on virgin or delta indirect this by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly i just couldn t wait to get off 
1620, gatwick to st lucia return out bound was world traveller return club arriving the evening before went to baggage drop reading instructions we were approached and offered help by a ba staff member check in cheerfully done ba airport staff faultless seats food and entertainment good drinks plentiful staff attentive and friendly return trip flight crew greeted us with smiles and showed us to our seats club seats with headphones eye masks socks blankets etc drinks service started straight away and available all flight dinner and breakfast terrific staff attentive and friendly all flight all in all both flights were on clean aircraft with friendly attentive crew we couldn t fault our flights however i have sympathy for those who have troubles sad that happy passengers only a few post a positive review thank you ba we shall be flying with you again 
1621, london heathrow to bangkok we had already flown ba from bangkok to london a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked j and k seats check in at lhr was good lounge at t was packed friday afternoon and i was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight no priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn t even get to our seats on boarding toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door why wasn t it fixed prior to the flight for some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet not good enough food and wine were ok and crew were good flat bed was good disembarking was slow same movies as ba four weeks earlier 
1622, singapore to london heathrow after reading the negative reviews and the press about ba of late i was not expecting much at all from this trip terminal is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with ba we checked in and cleared security within minutes we secured seats on the upper deck of the a which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine ba cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft no hello from her or acknowledgement once we got to our seats there was no space left in the overhead lockers no help from cabin crew but didn t expect any either they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags food was kept to the bare minimum for this hour journey with hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast nothing in between i was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast we got more food and snacks on our qantas flight from singapore to australia which was much shorter at hours i still cannot understand how ba are considered a star airline qantas also a star airline was much better in all i was not disappointed with ba as i prepared myself for the worst i would only fly them again if i can score cheap seats 
1623, london heathrow to stockholm arlanda ba is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices i m a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly ba primarily to maintain it not any more it s not worth bothering with the galleries lounge at heathrow now the hot food has been replaced most of the time with sandwiches and cakes the small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc have gone too and i m now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights even weeks ahead it s hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff stewards they don t seem to care anymore the last time i flew premium economy the food was inedible just about to book with another airline on principle i have to say i hope ba ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave if you re going to be a low cost airline charge low cost prices 
1624, bangkok to london heathrow boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all the flight was packed full the inflight entertainment system didn t work for the entire flight this is a hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly hours i have noticed that ba don t seem to care about ife not working on ba and ba as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers the captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn t the cabin crews fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction he explained that the system had overheated well that calms things i do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba flight i never want to experience again so i was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available however i was told they had been withdrawn i was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals the cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the toilets passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern ie blocking doors i also experienced sinus problems pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing airplanes the air being very dry with little humidity i do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches sinus pain and congestion i only experience this after flying on s and there are flight crew forums on line discussing air quality problems the captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew my email to the ceo was forwarded to customer services no surprises there customer services who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks i was advised that the lack of ife would be investigated by their maintenance team they would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i didn t expect them to by way of compensation i was given avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and ba s level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it therefore i will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change 
1625, istanbul to london i am sad to say british airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one it hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and british airways except the ticket price my disappointment is so high because i had high expectations i paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins i haven t flown british airways for years and i shocked by how much it had gone downhill it is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers save you coins for something else you don t get what you pay for with british airways 
1626, belfast to seoul via london heathrow pretty poor short haul connection to london was good before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul flight from london was very cramped i m slightly above average height but by no means a giant and i really struggled to get comfortable seat was too narrow very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what i assume was the processor for the ife system for the seat in front the seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around hours the food was ok nothing special not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough as a child i remember the food on ba flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong staff are one of the few things ba has going for it at the minute one of the few things left from the ba of old when it was actually worthy of the name friendly staff on the flight and in the airport flew the same route with qatar airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league one last note you build this terminal which is meant to be world class firstly there is no smoking area although we re constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to you expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can t even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you re normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in i am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit like most people i recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop 
1627, paris to london heathrow i am a ba gold guest list member with tier points i cannot believe what is happening to ba the attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product cramped seats chaotic boarding every flight announced our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags in other words they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage now you pay for food and even water two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight how can they let a cost cutting ceo with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline it is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service a shame to be called british this airline is in terminal decline and i need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline don t pay for ba shortfall use cheap alternatives its the same service 
1628, world traveler plus from heathrow to sfo the only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re booted boarding was pretty much average with no zone boarding for economy just everybody get on first time in premium economy and we loved it where ba shined was post flight i did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bag discovered it hours drive later got contacted by staff at ba luggage and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault immediately volunteered to fedex overnight my bag to me also having just come from a cruise on a line famed for its food the food stood up surprisingly well compared to oceania s 
1629, buenos aires to london i was warned that ba had gone downhill but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight to start with you cannot reserve your seat prior to check in unless after paying over for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional per leg to have your seat reserved i call this insane to be honest so i waited and waited and waited till check in opened and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat latam lounge in buenos aires was nice food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower with ground crew extremely nice and attentive boarding was sort of a mess as ba let frequent flyers not flying business board through the business class door so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane crew simply unable to handle this process so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding aircraft was a class boeing and looked a bit tired seat was the absolute worst part of this flight as it is narrow too hard to have a nice sleep and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a wall on one side and being exposed to people trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side once flat it is a little short too even for me i m cm high no giant here and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible therefore you have literally no space to store anything not even your glasses if you wear them food was just ok i still can t understand how ba can run out of entr e options in business class crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working entertainment system made me smile a bit as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier economy class ones to sum up it was an average flight if it was not for the lie flat seat i would call it more a premium economy experience than a business one ba needs to improve business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all european carriers not even to compare the middle east airlines 
1630, gatwick to pisa check in at gatwick a breeze chaotic boarding process though flight took off approximately minutes late the cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that ba have going for them middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room as for the catering ba are getting this wrong why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards i hardly call cheese on toast a satisfactory meal choice despite calling it croque monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it i hope mr cruz reads these reviews it is not what the customer wants ba are turning into a high cost no frills airline so much for their motto to fly to serve remember mr cruz and mr walsh there are other airlines offering a much better service 
1631, flew british airways from london to dubai to start with awful seats i felt like i was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me need more room then it was rude staff i was shocked to top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way back when i interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me when i moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me i m a female travelling alone and i felt frightened by that just shows how little space everyone has been given i m really disappointed with ba 
1632, stuttgart to london with british airways how things have changed passengers now queue at gate as with easyjet or ryanair rather than sitting and waiting to be called unsurprisingly boarding in stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic unsure who was entitled to what cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of british airways to a budget airline how visible this was few people bothered to purchase the over priced snacks and drinks on offer once that was out of the way the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley chatted and munched away at the spare food from the business class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear at the rear i noticed that one of the two lavatories for economy class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy not least because of the constant queues alongside them everything about british airways now is shabby telling passengers how little they are valued and this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations my ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat but at the appointed time there were only four choices left so no i won t be flying them again unless all other options fail 
1633, flew nice to gatwick for a sandwich in club class we travel in business class whether long haul or in europe for a better experience this is even more important now since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the stewardship of se or cruz it started badly when we discovered once more that the flight was not at the terminal but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus just like a charter flight i asked a staff member why this was so to be told that the terminal was too small to cope but i noticed low cost carrier norwegian was parked on a jetty we had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal those at the rear of club often have no option due to catering limitations passengers were offered a choice of a curry i think yum or salmon yuck by the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left this is high in potassium a fish i must avoid i asked why the other dish had run out by the second row only two were loaded was the reply what two only for the whole of club yes i asked what else was on board only to be told that i would have to pay for an m s sandwich from economy before some help from our avios the tickets cost it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way the very nice cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard pun and migrate to other carriers i d rather fly easyjet and spend the change on a nice meal 
1634, london lgw to lima booked to fly out in premium economy and back in business overnight i like ba s website that allows you split classes like this in the event got upgraded to business both ways no idea why i am not a frequent flyer flights left and arrived on time gatwick s sunday morning check in scrum is awful all ba cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful food very good outward slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the peru catering supplier cabin clean but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tired ife screens are old and small plane was g ymms both ways hate the ba penny pinching that even when you have paid they still want another to pick a seat 
1635, punta cana to gatwick return i would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with ba but can find nothing the layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them in more than years of traveling i have not been in a worse business class the selection of films and music is limited and the screen small the food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk i do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary i have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and i wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold i know that many former ba customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and i regret that i join that group that will if possible never fly ba again 
1636, washington to london heathrow return british airways seems to be having an identify crisis are they a full service or a low cost carrier the meals have been cut back to almost nothing seat selection fees abound and checked baggage fees may apply depending upon the the type of ticket purchased united airlines now has a better trans atlantic coach product than ba food on the outbound overnight flight breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar on the return flight dinner was tiny small amounts of food in half filled bowls presented on a large tray as if to emphasize the lack of food and the pre landing snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar given the lack of food ba should just switch to buy on board so at least fewer people would go hungry flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food seat fees i don t know of any other full service carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket just assume it will cost you another or more per ticket on ba luggage fees completely opaque policy on our outbound trip we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item on our return we were told checked bags would be extra although the kindly baggage check in attendant waived the fee for us no doubt he too is as much a victim of ba s indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers entertainment boeing outbound with good modern on demand ife system on the return a boeing the system was an older on demand system with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable cabin crews were generally friendly in fairness both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong but ba just feels cheap and stingy will likely fly the competition in the future 
1637, new york jfk to london heathrow return my review is based on three different criteria service food and seat comfort overall the service was very good the flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight and very professional any request was handled in a timely manner the flight was full but service did not suffer the food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible a choice of thai vegatable curry or a chicken dish which i ate one bite of the highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granache also they have eliminated the second meal snack service all they served was tea coffee and a cookie very poor indeed seat comfort was the best i ve experienced in economy i managed hours of sleep on a hour crossing the slideable headrests allow your head not to bob if not for the disgusting food i would give a 
1638, malaga to gatwick the seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only or degrees impossible to relax food and drinks including coffee and water are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole plane we were sitting in row of and it took us nearly hours to be served and only cards are accepted which makes things worse appalling if you want to fly like this fly ryanair for a fraction of the price 
1639, stavanger to las vegas via london heathrow this is a salute to the fantastic staff at terminal helping my group out when everything seemed lost because of american airlines terrible customer service the trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with ba booking under aa flights from lhr to las via jfk the trip took place on april rd we risked being stranded with out of travelers at lhr because of aa somehow magically losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping rather blaming everyone else the ba service personnel spent hours trying to solve it and decided to take matters in their own hands they got us travelers on their direct flight from lhr to las the day after arranging for accommodation transport to from the airport and dinner breakfast even though aa was mainly responsible for our journey the service on board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration seats was good food all right complimentary drinks and very welcome the ife was great the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft s for this type of long haul but no particular issues 
1640, flew with british airways from london heathrow to moscow return over easter the plane was old seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet on the way to moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor the food itself was miserable stone cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as i noticed while queuing for toilet and there were only two for a fully booked economy class on the way back to london had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that i literally could not even cross my legs as my knees were stuck into the seat in front seats were not reclining either the food was even worse than on the inbound flight stone cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over four hours flight do not fly ba to russia it employs tactics of easyjet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service 
1641, copenhagen to mexico city via london heathrow upper deck window seat british airways uses a configuration with every second seat backwards to serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat it also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you this could be great or horrible food is nothing special but service is polite bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day i had to pick them up myself would fly again as usually have good fares to mexico 
1642, gatwick to rome return outward flight the plane was full booked and paid for an aisle seat but no legroom and narrow seat did not eat on the aircraft landed on time return flight left rome late again full this time i booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit more leg room food on the plane was from m s chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue the food bore little resemblance to the photograph dry and not filled i feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food receive payment you can t use cash and then clear it all up passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served british airways european flights are nothing more than a no frills airline so much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service this is not good enough 
1643, prague to london heathrow british airways have lost the plot ba is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare check in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed such as gold members bronze members families business class silver members they do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it s a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane seating is fair though leg room is tight the flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which was fine there is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail s pace with a trolley i can t believe ba now make passengers pay extra for food and drink ba shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past i wonder what has happened to ba for it to have fallen so far this will be my last flight with ba unless there are no other options available as ba is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore 
1644, london to istanbul i am ever increasingly disappointed with british airways the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited the seats lounge food aircraft cleanliness on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines my most recent flight back i took an aisle seat for a change the flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets this is really quite irritating especially during meal service no attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints i find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well i think ba don t care on the flight from istanbul electronic devices are banned other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you british airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment or even extra magazines on the flight they really don t appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class 
1645, paris orly to new york via london unlike some american carriers and some other european carriers there is no beverage service on short haul flights tea costs pounds economy overseas is a joke too they bring the premium drinks service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had they replaced the nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options cookies snack sized kit kats and snack sized mars you may only have one i asked to have an extra snack i was told no only one onboard media is decent but nothing to write home about i classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline you do get one meal after all and entertainment but not much better than that 
1646, los angeles to london heathrow i have to agree with all the other reviews on here ba have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling there s just nothing positive left to say about them from the newly refurbished that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats to the disgusting cheap meals the flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they re embarrassed and have nothing to offer all this would be fine but british airways still charges premium prices and for what i just took a flight on the same route with virgin atlantic and what a difference all the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper i m afraid to say i won t be flying ba anymore unless it s to use up avios i d acquired 
1647, london to milan linate i landed in london after taking connecting flights from orange county california to dallas and then dallas to london both on american i landed in london at p m this flight did not leave until p m i went to the british airways help desk and asked if i could get on the flight they told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as i had only one carry one and nothing checked i went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as i would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket so i had to wait another hours i have now been traveling for hours at the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said i would have to check it i explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and i have had the same bag on over flights as carry on i explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and i have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as i will be getting in late they were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane i decided to carry it on to the plane it fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight there were other bags that were bigger than mine they actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold if that wasn t annoying enough i could not believe i asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water they also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea i could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was british airways to end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process i am a travel agent and will never book for someone else or myself unless there is no other viable choice 
1648, london to nice return british airways has gone down no more food on board arrived in nice and it was hour before we foudd our baby s buggy in another section altogether no one informed when returning no buggy arrived at heathrow my two year old is now without a buggy and no one knows anything i was told three different messages we have the buggy we don t have the buggy terrible service all round the airline has gone down and staff really don t care especially in heathrow baggage office they simply don t cater for families or care 
1649, baltimore to nice via london my ordeal started when i could not check in online i called ba and they said the flight is under airport control and i have to check in at the airport fair enough but i should have known something was wrong when i get to the airport hours ahead i wanted to get a good seat i was told that premium economy was overbooked and that i was involuntarily being bumped to economy never mind that i bought and paid for the ticket months ago the staff were not even nice about it quite beligerent they offered me a compensation card for where they got this amount i don t know i would have preferred the seat then they tell me i need to contact ba for a refund of the difference in price why should i need to contact them they moved me they know they moved me shouldn t it be automatic so i am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake i did send an e mail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them it has been a week i had a horrible flight i have severe back pain one reason i booked premium for the extra room which was made worse by my economy seat my screen did not work for movies although the flight attendants did try it is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip fast forward while in france i tried to use the compensation card declined so i tried to use it on amazon and nespresso online also declined really ba i sent another e mail telling them the card is not working nothing i have flown ba in the past and have been happy with the not anymore i have had it with ba i will not fly with them again because when there is a problem they do not come through 
1650, a business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from sofia to boston i have to say that my wife daughter and i were completely pleased somewhat surprisingly so quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in sofia decent contract lounge excellent service and food onboard both the club europe flight to london and club world flight to boston terrific flight attendants and much better food than i am used to on united lh or austrian i have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals all three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best i have had all three included flavorful sauces which is something lh always omits from its special meals the galleries lounge in the b satellite terminal was excellent not as much food on offer as in the lh and os lounges or even the new ua lounge at heathrow t but it was quiet and comfortable and we really liked the quirky club world business cabin the middle section is great for couples every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid there were four toilets for business class my only complaint the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class as the fight was not full i probably could have gotten seats together at checkin but i did not want to take the risk and ba got additional revenue which is obviously why they do it 
1651, an excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from hong kong to copenhagen through london despite being in economy class the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive serving our needs before we even needed to ask they were friendly and made us feel completely at home the on board entertainment selection was very extensive with high quality options english and international movies of high caliber and the screen interface was modern and easy to use the seats on the flight from hkg lhr on the boeing er were new and much more comfortable than the average older seat the pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence arrival time weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive with regards to the pre boarding ground service one of the check in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and i so that we could sit together and have a window seat both of which were not available at check in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand we really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant this was not my first time flying with british airways but it had been a long time since i last boarded a long haul flight with them and the trip exceeded my expectations british airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be 
1652, london heathrow to larnaca british airways used to be a good airline now it is just another expensive airline with low cost service the ticket prices are still very high but they don t offer any food or drinks any more for short haul flights also they do not let you to choose a seat unless you pay really dissapointed 
1653, flew london gatwick to san jose costa rica we have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in british airways the service on this flight was appalling travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i e drinks towels etc the normal routine stuff on too many occasions we had to request attention chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row at the front of the service collection of waste items had to be requested the galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp toilet bags are cheap ba have totally lost the plot they are no longer a premium service and willie walsh and co need to take a flight on emirates qatar etc to realise their failings business seating configuration is ridiculous passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs as part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect again service is in reverse but the costs aren t if ba wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares i don t think they have a clue what they are doing in future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary the only positive of the trip was the lounge at gatwick the lounge at san jose is a joke 
1654, the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow was extremely uncomfortable although the entertainment was quite good on the tvs the food was horrible plasticy tasting and above all not tasty the flight from heathrow back to jfk had many delays although this was out of anyone s control it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane hours at first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about the other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane i wish the discomfort of the plane bad food and time of delays were reduced dramatically so far not a good first trip on british airways 
1655, very very poor customer service from british airways myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of oman while upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to oman when we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in oman to get our boarding passes on arriving in oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full we were left there for hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments after pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination new delhi we were approximately hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day to say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement 
1656, i had to change my flight back from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital i d flown out first class and had a business class return i do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable but ba were absolutely no help at all they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class world traveller plus which cost one way the first class fight to was ok nice cabin crew and good food but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting no snacks water etc in the galley like there used to be absolutely no help on the return trip despite requests before the flight because i was walking with a stick i d requested an aisle seat had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as i tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick really poor value at and rubbish seats uncomfortable and tv screens that aren t great the food was awful clear that costs are being cut massively maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful it s a pity really it s obviously bas call if they want to be a no frills airline but i d rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they ve decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with someone else 
1657, philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january i ve always enjoyed flying british airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united the long haul flight was ok food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight however it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight i wasn t too fussed about that until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food by this point i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll which never happened because the trolly never reached me to top it all off we left heathrow late because of a computer problem meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh but i understand that these things happen at times however recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive furthermore the headphone jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight which was disappointing on the up side the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always considering i got the flight for a good price it was ok although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future i m indifferent in recommending flying with ba if they suit you best then go ahead but don t go out your way to fly them if there are cheaper or direct options just go for them instead because there isn t anything particularly outstanding 
1658, well where do you start this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand the ticket price was in excess of the lounges at lhr t need work yes british airways are investing but long overdue the small lounge for b gates needs to be re thought and offer better food options to the aircraft its been refitted apparently but should be scrapped the seats remain tired the vanity screen was not working properly the entertainment system is past its best with smudges and scratches the carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed the toilets are old overall the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium regarding the crew they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves sad but true too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management on this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e g waitrose fruit and yogurts they have also stopped the ice cream food served was not good saving grace was the meat platter but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese blankets are faded and ragged the toilet bags are a joke cheap and nasty this route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder ba need to invest in a new fleet re energise the crew change the catering and get a few more choices upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter 
1659, london heathrow to singapore business class flight from heathrow to singapore flight took off over hours late with no real explanation why and we were not kept informed it seems ba is these days later in taking off during the flight i felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset the main meal we were served was absolutely awful it was supposed to be an asian meal of a curry with prawns but was just like gunge and was not edible i really don t know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed which seemed totally unnecessary as i was hungry between courses i went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason i have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years i have been a ba silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew i always try and fly qatar where possible when going to asia now as the service is better and often the price too there is nothing redeeming about ba 
1660, what was i thinking flying this airline for the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lost two years ago london to dublin our bags were lost for two days so this flight our bags are left in london again now i m stuck in dubai in winter clothes missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our bags to turn up it s only been days now in the same clothes upside service on board ba was excellent however business class on ba europe flight is no different to economy so don t pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat 
1661, just got off the flight from heathrow to new orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights i have ever had to endure the legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight first time i have ever been unable to open my laptop to work i now understand why they don t offer wifi on board the seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say then it is a dreadful experience in my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight i have travelled a lot over the years first business and economy and had a gold british airways card but this was just terrible and i don t really know what ba hope to achieve in the long run i can guarantee i will seek other airlines first before considering them again anybody contemplating going to new orleans from heathrow fly with somebody else and get an internal connection you won t regret it as for ba they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as trump has of winning the nobel prize for oratory were it to exist 
1662, we flew on a reward flight from london heathrow to brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience we were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour the lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert what we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy and seemed rather worse than usual the only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle which if you are a bit chunky like me it was quite difficult to manoeuvre this all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers and we like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that ba is being turned into vueling if it weren t for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on ba who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe we would not travel on ba we would try to find another full service airline because we enjoy flying 
1663, the cabin crew bar one lazy individual were excellent t feels like a monopoly galleries lounge food is simply appalling between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food unused hot food is removed at am sharp why not leave it so all you have is bread and stodgy croissants the upstairs of the a was in need of a serious clean cabin crew friendly although you can sense lower morale ba flights are often late now in my experience the club world a seats aren t comfortable despite everyone knowing crossing over someone s legs too get out is still a nuisance there is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing i had one bloke shout at me when i d been waiting long before him and he d just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued let down after years of loyalty and serious spending we re not getting what we re paying for although charged that s the sad bit 
1664, i am just sad to have to write this review i changed from lufthansa to british airways more then years ago because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way mostly flying between berlin the us and in recent years very frequently cape town ba had more modern planes innovative products like a great rather new first class lie flat seats in business class a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise that none of my initial reasons to choose ba still exists with the exception of the great cabin staff that i feel really sorry for the owners hired lex cruz last year a very experienced low cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can turning ba into a low cost carrier unfortunately the result is a pity no more service on short haul flights reduced service only paid snacks on long haul worn s to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in s with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards british airways as a premium airline is lost realistically for year to come even with my status renewed i don t think i will fly them again if i don t have to meanwhile i understand that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future and keep their great staff on ground and on board 
1665, no no no british airways you ve messed up someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights just like many other airlines do and they said let s provide food from m s that will make our offering classier than the rest the problem on my flight from marrakech to london was that it being dinner time loads of passengers wanted food and drink so the service was inevitably snail paced a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customers sitting near the back of the plane my wife and i got served hours into the hour flight by which time our tongues were hanging out but what s this only two sandwiches left and we bagged the last two packets of crisps you re promising things you can t deliver ba there is such as thing as advertising standards and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards the cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone s payment card failed to register on their machine hint for frequent flyers if your card just doesn t work you get your food and drink for free meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstances other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare the process i call ryanisation of british airways is almost complete you now charge for checked baggage yes i know that s indirect but only idiots can t see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats and now you ve devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on short haul what even ba used to call medium haul flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane oh and by the way why don t the cabin crew deploy the a overhead monitors that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision british airways the world s least favourite airline 
1666, having only flown easyjet ryanair for all my short haul journeys over the last years or so i was pleased to see a relatively low cost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome in hindsight i wish i d booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other low cost short haul airlines certainly not worse narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable even on a hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small my knees were grazing the seat in front lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m s supplied food i am more than happy to pay for this on a short haul flight and don t expect anything for free it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions sadly being sat in row this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything no sandwiches no fruit salad no yoghurt i asked what they did have their response bottle of water or a kit kat after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least they never give us enough food it s mad they give us sandwiches for the whole flight needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low cost carriers sadly they probably sit about th or th down the list i d say i d give their long haul a chance but after this experience i won t bother what a shame 
1667, london heathrow to munich return it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore the loss of the free bar food service on european flights is a real step down even worse is the cynical way in which it happened downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an improvement to offer paid for m s food on board oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an improvement in service is beyond me not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine wouldn t recommend you do the same the card only payment system is chaos as well it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum hours in advance there were only or seats on the whole plane i could choose from i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat other carriers let you select seats at check in for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance and if you pick one of the preferred seats with easyjet you also get priority check in and boarding for your money not so with ba check in at t was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check in machine wouldn t work at all and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn t let me print a bag tag so i couldn t use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check in desks wasting time there was a minor delay due to fog but that wasn t ba s fault and didn t have a hige impact flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good on the way back our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real pro to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares the ability to switch between flights for free on the day could we no the earlier flight was full rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead in summary if flying ba on european routes these days be aware that ba is now a no frills carrier lower your expectations to this level and you ll probably have a pleasant flight 
1668, belfast to gibraltar via heathrow return i fly british airways when i can and have always been impessed and satisfied until now the flight from heathrow to gibraltar was uneventful clean aircraft no delays no issues apart from the lack of drinks snacks i d love to know who thought this would be a good idea flying short haul there is nothing to differentiate ba from easyjet or other no frills airlines add to this the lack of choice on their menu there are only a couple of sandwiches and if you don t like mayo or cheese you re out of luck well done ba you ve alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones the flight from heathrow to belfast is my main gripe the flight was meant to depart at but was delayed to hardly a big deal right wrong the gate only went up at this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft it was before everyone was boarded again hardly a big deal except that we didn t take off until which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as i was back too late to pick them up the flight itself was full which wouldn t have been too bad if there hadn t been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank i won t go into details but she smelled rancid i was a few rows back and so didn t get the worst of it but i could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all needless to say i didn t enjoy the flight at all i would go so far as to say that it s probably the worst flight i ve been on and i ve flown monarch and easyjet i did e mail ba with my concerns but they didn t bother to reply so again well done ba you re squandering customers good will toward you like you re burning fifty pound notes 
1669, flew from gatwick to cancun british airways have lost their way front line staff are still excellent but behind the scenes customer service is now at an all time low the quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers desert then 
1670, british airways has got it wrong on short european hauls malaga to gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class the food drink trolley will block access to the toilet seated at the tail end of the plane the food is very likely to run out on my flight the promised m s was limited to snacks water kitkat credit debit cards only no cash and this meant a very painfully slow service one working toilet for the economy class the other one was out of order but the business class toilet at the front was out of reach for the cattle class leaving me wait for over an hour i was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about minute a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle then of air turbulence the cabin crew seems desperate to get the trolley hence the slowness to the end of the cabin people needing the toilet was obviously not a priority they certainly did not let me pass during the minutes or more without air turbulence ba has gone cattle 
1671, london to new york it has been a long time since i have been on a british airways flight and time has not been kind t at lhr is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things are it just feels a bit hit and miss compared to changi or hk the flight itself was on an old b new seating and ife but very old the boarding process was chaotic extra security checks at the gate itself hardly surprising seat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrow the ife was great and that was the highlight the lunch served was so so but having eaten at the lounge it was left largely uneaten the biggest problem is the staff morale they all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way dim the lights and disappear evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for any wine was by the glass very cheap cutlery etc ba is a premium airline but looks to be offering a ryanair standard compared to the me or asian or my usual ride qantas ba have slipped significantly shame as it was a great airline to fly with at one time 
1672, flight from gatwick to grenada return with british airways lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane was clean what i struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights ba then expect you to pay an additional per person each way to reserve seats there were of us traveling so that adds in excess of to our flight cost ba will tell you that this is free hours before departure but actually days before departure most seats had gone i would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were seats together 
1673, flew from lisbon to london and return british airways never fails in terms of being on time but i will end my business with them after more then flights and having said very good things about them in the past they seem to be cutting corners with everything passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub just goes to a remote stand and takes forever to get to the terminal not worth the money spent 
1674, amsterdam to cape town via gatwick on our hour night flight i discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline spent hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when i returned home to amsterdam this is exactly what i did ba replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a gbp gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more what an insult its unfair that i paid the same price as the rest of the passengers that s unfair they do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter very arrogant and not customer friendly at all i feel cheated british airways obviously does not value their customers a gbp voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day but for a long overnight flight its an insult sent e mails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore 
1675, i was scheduled to fly ba from miami to london on january th boarding and departure went normal but than close to take off the ordeal began captain announced a technical problem at approx pm and that s when the horror started overall we ended up sitting in the plane until am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed we were given accomodation but that was a mins drive from miami airport check in took another mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer was re booked for a flight the next day but downgraded from premium economy to economy old tatty very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone worst of all the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in london and cancel my connection to munich total additional expenses not counting the difference between premium economy which i paid for and economy was including the gap between economy and premium economy probably now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference submitted my compensation claims incl proof for the above expenses as per protocol online no confirmation followed up with a call had to wait approx mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but i would be compensated for the remaining no further confirmation email etc was paid a mere into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were decided to do some research and it appears that under eu law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than hours my delay was hours absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product how on earth ba deserves stars in beyond me 
1676, london heathrow to los angeles worst flight ever with british airways you can see why they have fallen out of the top very lazy and oblivious staff members they ran out of food during both meal times we were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the trays all we got was oh sorry and a re re heated meal after leaving the service light on for minutes looking for some water i went to the back of the plane to find members of staff reading the paper even after complaining to customer service after the flight we weren t treated much better if it wasn t because for the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time 
1677, i have never had such a bad experience with british airways before the cabin staff were rude lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service the flight was from mauritius to gatwick on sunday th march landing monday morning th march no second cup of coffee offered at breakfast we had to take our own plates back before landing and on two occasions the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks food was good the staff were absolutely appalling we pay good money for business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what i expect from my national airline 
1678, london heathrow to hong kong the new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat but i was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering for a hour flight in a premium economy i would have assumed it would be similar to others offering meals mid flight snacks and other bits i was very wrong we had a bar service and meal there was then nothing until breakfast exactly the same as the economy offering this is appalling british airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering i went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft they completely understood customer frustrations they just have nothing to give ba was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with not so much anymore the crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had for anyone flying ba bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids 
1679, frankfurt to hong kong via london this will definitely be my last time with british airways i have already changed my return ticket to cathay pacific the business class experience with ba has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor short flight to heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful probably worth about at most seat legroom is awful and not far off the inch size that economy is being cut to staff onboard were friendly and that is all lounge at t was again very poor crowded food choice and standards like a cheap motorway caf dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning the toilet was disgusting evening departure to hkg and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat onboard the ba club world product is lousy cheap low quality amenities a very poor meal choice and standard washrooms unstocked and quite dirty the cabin worn and scruffy as an expat living in germany i have remained loyal to ba until now but this is the last time i will waste our company money using them it is quite clear that ba are abusing their monopoly situation at heathrow cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation and profitability of the airline if you are undecided about choosing ba over another airline quite simply do not consider ba you will be very disappointed and feel cheated 
1680, london to nairobi return in february during the industrial action we found the crew to be friendly and attentive the food was ok i had the spicy chicken which i didn t much care for it was rather unusually badly prepared with great hunks of chicken and vegetables just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating on the return flight we were flight attendants down due to the strike but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff i know that there has been a lot of gripes about ba downgrading its services but these flights were really good and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time didn t much care for the cereal bars but the cups of tea made up for that 
1681, london heathrow to edinburgh on british airways domestic economy check in at t okay although a little slow fast track security quick i used the ba galleries north lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon boarding through a on to a clean looking full a i had seat a which has no window crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on ba not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad the footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards ba in order to maintain my executive club silver status oneworld sapphire i have to take ba flights each year which i can do on domestic routes but the additional or so european and international flights i take each year will be either with other oneworld carriers or others and not ba the management at british airways are making false claims when suggesting it s what our passengers asked for i travelled with ba times last year and i wasnt asked if i wanted a devaluation of the ba executive club or was i asked if i wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats i most certainly was never asked if i wanted the simple snack and a coffee on uk and european flights replaced by buy your own food neither was i asked if i mind paying for snacks on international flights unfortunately british airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease it s shareholders 
1682, toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in mins unfortunately first lounge was full of gold card members and so had to sit in the biz lounge good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to a excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew a weird but tasty starter of a cured dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked good cheeses and all courses selected were available after some decent sleep a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight t north lounge was packed with a min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty decent breakfast selection of hot rolls fruit cereals etc quick board for the flight to berlin ridiculous leg room at inches max very cramped don t like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions on time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever including low cost airlines a full a was cramped insufficient bins with one out of service and the now infamous terrible leg room i understand this is to get even worse when ba moves to pax on an a in line with charter and low cost carriers slow food and drink service with little take up some couldn t buy as no cash accepted not even juice water and coffee offered for free this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class the only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver the whole plane looked fed up subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish final leg to toronto on a included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service poor lunch of roast chicken weird mash and overcooked greens not biz class food and pretty average more like economy food afternoon tea was fine with a fast deplaning and bags on the long haul legs the ife was identical to christmas poor choice little new material clearly even the ife is now down graded the biz class product once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the across and lack of privacy how the mighty have fallen experiencing four classes on four legs showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul the short haul legs to from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you re getting and it s reflected in the fare and extras with less leg room fewer toilets reduced quality and or no refreshments and a general downgrading of service the only thing not reduced is the price this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios it s only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point i m off hello star alliance 
1683, this will be my last time to book a trip with them i booked a return trip for april from london to istanbul a few months in advance they ended up cancelling my flight and moving me to the flight which would not work for me after the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan i left it for a few months on calling yesterday they told me that i had accepted the changes as it was months ago i told her that the other agent suggested that i wait and decide later this was followed by the fact that i had purchased a cabin bag only fare but i travel with a ipad or laptop with the recent electronics ban ba were going to force me to pay for a bag to check my device although this was not my fault to add to this everything is paid for now reduced legroom pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in i can see no reason to fly ba any longer i called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty i have rebooked with turkish airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute they include food checked bag drinks and seat selection and sometimes a boeing on this route 
1684, heathrow terminal is a great airport dedicated to british airways the check in service was not as fast as they say it was normal the ba staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help i was very excited to fly on the new dreamliner from london heathrow to dubai but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard first the ife felt very old and not clear at all something you d expect on non refurbished b s choice of movies and tv shows are pretty good so i can t fault ba on that the seats are nice the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay cabin crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us i was waiting more than minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head the food is okay your first meal its hot and options were good two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane however and this is a big however your second meal we were given a breakfast bar that was disgraceful how much of a budget are they on now i thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us breakfast bars instead but on the return journey we were given a cookie for lunch people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace i just can t believe how downhill ba has gone it s incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too i think they re running out of money unfortunately i booked my flights to marrakech before this expereince and i promise that would be the last time i fly with ba 
1685, british airways use a version of the with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied they make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area seats are narrow seat cushions are hard and i had a large person next to me both trips i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible food was passable and no more but there were two meals on the long flight cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights both flights on time these ancient s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent 
1686, i am years old was scheduled to fly from montreal to heathrow on january th and from there to athens on february st where i would catch another connection to cyprus i was delayed in montreal for hours never given a reason why stuck in the aircraft from pm until am cause customs was closed had to wait another hours at heathrow missed my connection to athens and my connection from athens to cyprus was never offered accomodation or compensation had to book another flight on february nd and book a stay at a hotel close to athens airport contacted british airways they replied with the usual vague comments i followed up and never got a reply clearly i am being ignored i will never use british airways again 
1687, flew british airways from london heathrow to innsbruck overall just about ok for value for money its a route where the price difference between economy and club is often no more than a which is just as well because outbound slow check in overcrowded lounge in desperate need of refurbishment particularly the horrible toilets no priority boarding all bussed like sardines on the long journey to t where the plane was sat on board flight early nice breakfast good cc return no lounge no voucher to compensate for no lounge no priority security no priority boarding cc again good on board and an ok lunch seats same in business as they are in economy business ticket meant skis carried free which would have cost or so in economy 
1688, london heathrow to dublin booked business class expecting extra legroom but seats are the same as in economy i was and still am disgusted what a rip off how do they get away with it answer people like me pay excessive air fares to fly with them well not any more disgraceful they should be ashamed 
1689, london to dublin i had not flown with british airways for over months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to dublin from london heathrow terminal it all started again i had downloaded the ba app from the apple app store and i tried to check in the night before using the app but i was getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time i thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when i was sat in the taxi to the airport on the app i noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx hour and some minutes considering it is a local flight and i was flying with hand luggage only i decided to stop so that i can get some food as having flown multiple times in the past months at least once and sometimes twice every week i was under the impression that as long as i am at the airport an hour and minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues after all that s the whole point of flight updates when i got the ba self service machine with minutes remaining in the original flight timing and almost hours before the actual flight time i had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to zone e to get a boarding pass printed by the counter staff after waiting minutes in the queue bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over hours remaining until flight take off i was told that the flight has been closed and as i was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and i ca not fly on that flight so i will have to take the next one from am flight i was moved to am flight after discussing with the check in manager i was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesn t make the rules needless to say that i had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off if this is how the ba customers are to be treated i e they have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then i for one will most definitely not be flying ba again the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case they are not putting any value on my other customers time i e we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late 
1690, london to barbados having used avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance the crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available british airways policy of offering a fun size mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable in our opinion the airline are offering a budget experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them 
1691, london heathrow to bangkok first time flying british airways i had heard all the bad reviews about them and they did not disappoint tired old aircraft seat would not fully recline unlike the person in front of me entertainment system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip i did not even use it much in the end food was good i will give them that check in very fast and efficient plane pretty much on time no wifi or charging facilities onboard 
1692, flew british airways from beijing london heathrow emerald member so a one minute check in with a dedicated counter was appreciated the bgs lounge which ba uses was a welcome surprise owing to the fact that there are many japanese food options at that time jal also shares the lounge business section almost the same as first albeit more people boarding seamless here is where the value ends two meals for hour flight but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of highlife where there is a sweet treat menu with sugar family items priced around each i declined that and stayed hungry the meals served were carb rich pasta tasteless and a rice meal dry tasteless i have minimal needs but i do know ba has cut back so much now that it really is drink meal drink meal on trans con flights crew were friendly enough free exit row seats for friend and i emerald benefit 
1693, flew from london heathrow to geneva fast track through security at lhr terminal is a misnomer if you want fast track choose an airline departing from t or t boarding aircraft a nightmare no priority boarding at gate herded onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck line up on tarmac and steps to board on board seats arranged for benefit of british airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers three seats each side of the aisle with the centre one blanked out no extra seat width or legroom knees against the sear in front unless one sits with a twisted spine not good similar arrangement on newer british airways a s overall not what one expects from business class and negates any positive aspect of the flight 
1694, montreal to london heathrow flight and service was cheap except for the price i expected better and this was not value for money advance seat selection is expensive just plain gouging on top of ticket price it is complimentary on air canada even with boarding pass pre arranged there is no bag drop in montreal just one long line british airways ba staff air canada next time 
1695, gothenburg to san francisco via heathrow returning from phoenix ba now charges for snacks and drinks in eurotraveller a move that surprised me as ba is now nothing but a very expensive ryanair or easyjet after arriving in london we started out with a hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn boeing planes were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn b seats were comfortable but the aircraft was dirty ba has cut back on the amenities in world traveller it used to be a sleeping mask socks a tooth brush and headphones now only headphones were provided returning from phx on an even older b overall i was disappointed a couple of years ago i switched to ba from lufthansa as i find london a more convenient transit airport while both airlines offering the same high levels of service but what has happened this used to be a great airline which now sadly is nothing more than a low cost carrier charging premium prices will switch to lufthansa from now on 
1696, gatwick to mauritius hour flight delayed hour due to no cleaners advised by first officer that cabin crew had to clean the plane crumbs on seat and greasy windows otherwise fairly average flight until woken up hours out of mauritius to be advised that toilets on plane were full and no further use please just after waking up most people like to visit the toilet surely anyway seatbelt signs then illuminated though little if any turbulence one hour out first officer came on again with further abject apology re toilets not working as apparently the toilet tanks hadn t been emptied at lgw before departure two hours with legs crossed for over pax surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanks trust they maintain the engines better 
1697, san diego to london an excellent flight with really good club world service from crew the crew in the upper deck knew their jobs anticipated requirements and smiled when delivering service no complaints and a decent nights sleep they knock us airlines into a cocked hat and i should know as i had the bitter experience during my stateside trip 
1698, flew british airways from london heathrow to dubai i do not normally write reviews but i was so disappointed with the service and flights from ba for a recent night stay in a dubai with my wife that i had to make a comment some of the staff not all were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve me will try and use other airlines in the future wherever possible 
1699, amsterdam to gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class onward flight to st lucia paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft tired worn interior and the food reflected this too outbound crew were helpful and energetic keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used inbound flight was the same tired interior unappealing menu and indifferent service the only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me days later when i travelled home to british airways staff in st lucia for managing this so well i hope that ba will be renewing its fleet soon it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made 
1700, my last few experiences with british airways have been extremely disappointing they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy on my most recent trip from london to toulouse i booked using my avios points i then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so so i ended up spending more on flight than i had for they now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights i even had to purchase a bottle of water this is akin to a lcc such as easyjet but the fares are still much more expensive in addition i received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could i contact british airways about my booking i had received one missed call with no message during working hours having eventually dug out the right customer services number these were not provided on the email i tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long i eventually gave up 
1701, edinburgh to luanda via heathrow british airways has started charging inflated prices for food on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines the standard is pathetic and it is no surprise that the flight was empty they are just a very expensive easyjet ryanair 
1702, london heathrow to las vegas never had need to write a bad airline review before now british airways was the worst airline i have ever flown with old shabby and dirty plane tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when i arrived the only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me the seat i then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back old food stains and on the belt no drink served with meal except water when i eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left i had a white wine when i asked for a second yes only a second drink on a hour flight i was told they had run out of wine also i had to have orange juice awful and rude staff with exception of one worst airline by far i have ever flown with 
1703, gatwick to bridgetown firstly couldn t book myself in online my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but i couldn t move him his seat was fixed so we had to leave mega early so i could sit near him luckily got the seat behind him food and seats terrible tea time snack an insult small cookies breakfast was a muesli bar i already have booked with ba again for tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct however my annual flights to barbados will be with virgin in future i have complained twice re check in meals and the broken tray table on the return trip and have been offered avios points that just ties me into flying with them again especially as they expire every year so will disappear before i might want to use them the cutbacks are a cut too far ba tip buy a sandwich in boots on way out and buy something to eat on way back before you go to the airport 
1704, flew gatwick to san jose costa rica return with ba at a very good price of return for both of us the flight out was a typically cramped atlantic crossing and my wife and i were separated and unable to sit together the cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs the food was average at best and lots of options ran out during the flight on the way back the plane left minutes late the crossing was quicker at hours some time was made up and cabin crew were very good my main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well there was nothing at all in my seat pocket not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there and wasn t the catering was really disgusting though i was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup truly horrible and the worst long haul catering i have ever been served i thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average such a shame that the middle east carriers are so much better in virtually every way sad and disappointing 
1705, orlando to london i had booked business class and i wanted to be comfortable unfortunately with british airways i paid all these money and at the end i was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again i checked in hours before the flight as soon as the online check in opened the system gave me only a single seat opposite to the direction of the airplane with no possibilty to be able to change it i called british airways main office to try to sort this out initially i was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to british airways at the airport as airport keeps some business class seats i called again the main office to talk to a different person in case i was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the aeroport as soon as i arrived at the airport at the check desk i was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me however they were going to fix it at the gate when i arrived at the gate i was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats i do not feel that it is worth paying for business with british airways and then getting all this chaos it was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me finally my lagguage that was priority came out last 
1706, newark to london heathrow this was the first time i have flown long haul ba for sometime although i am ba goldcard holder due to my travels on other oneworld carriers the lounge in newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate first section and food is only offered for business and first passengers super views over the airfield boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition this was a new boeing however the ying yang seat configuration no air vents high density poor quality food and very little of it very basic toilet facilities compared to american business class on the same route a shoe bag instead of amenity kit the product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions i asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about the arrivals lounge is grim tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small overall very poor and i will not fly with them again unless no other options 
1707, hyderabad to london i have travelled ba numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when i was returning from hyderabad to london from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin while the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing i have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles in this instance with british airways i was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i was shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i was told again and again no this is not possible after realising that british airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be done given the circumstances my answer was a to be handed a gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing i could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased after the flight i filed a claim with british airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even one response only adding to my understanding that british airways does not value myself as a customer or my business i am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline 
1708, london to chicago in my opinion british airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within europe and internationally especially as an economy passenger they are moving more towards being a budget airline there is no option of a free seat selection they charge for food on board on short haul flights on long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal avios and tier point awards have been slashed i will not be flying ba any more and will be taking my money elsewhere 
1709, london to vancouver return british airways is no longer good value for money the cost of premium economy compared with the quality of service food and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise the plane in both directions was old and shabby staff are fine but don t really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened of course you have the opportunity to pay an extra each way to choose a seat beforehand the food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the premium economy cabin the tv screens are dirty and small the system had to be reset on the flight out took quite a while for almost double the price of economy i don t think it makes sense to fly world traveller plus on this route 
1710, flew london heathrow to gibraltar this is probably the last time that i ll book a short haul with british airways from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday no matter how cheap they make it they can t overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates delays for take off slots long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport willie walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports slightly hollow laugh ba are further constrained by their class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers in economy are served by only x cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets on our flight of well over hours this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily seems like a structural flaw in their offering the other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed it took me back to the early days of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating so unless i m lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows i think i ll use regional airports and the better general service and available loos that come with a single class cabin no matter who the carrier is 
1711, this is my first time flying on ba s a daily service between london heathrow and singapore i chose a seat on the upper deck of the a seat a an exit row seat located just behind world traveller plus this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out the inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies the classical music selection was severely limited though bbc news was on the menu but ironically it was not available for some strange reason inflight service was basic there was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner in other words you would have to order your orange juice coke and wine at the same time cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal throughout the night of this red eye flight i did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks the lhr vce route was operated by the a british airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its european routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and m s snacks on the whole ba will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist i would choose another airline 
1712, british airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering i recently flew with ba from gatwick to marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of easyjet the catering with the new m s food can be described as nothing short of chaotic on the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a kitkat cost cutting includes removing toilets is one toilet for people realistic ba 
1713, london heathrow to cape town return this return journey was the worst long haul flight that i ve ever taken british airways boeing has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only toilets to cater for the front cabin queues were or people long continuously throughout the flight there was hardly any legroom and while it s good that the seats recline quite a way it s impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats the seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep i m not a large lady only kg and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally i gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face i couldn t focus on it the inflight meal was also very poor unlike the food we had on five internal flights on saa which was excellent british airways have lost the plot fly with someone else 
1714, oh dear cost cutting on british airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment flew kuwait to edinburgh via london aircraft are still comfortable timekeeping is good and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming however most of the cabin crew were mature and the food and drink offering is now minimal breakfast from kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables no not the omelette we used to have plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby lunch was a mars bar or similar i did not bother with the buy on board stuff on the flight to edinburgh i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba giggling at each other during the safety demonstration very unprofessional the evening meal out of london back to kuwait was more like a snack with a smallish steak three snap peas three baby carrots i counted the things and another babyfood potato thing breakfast was a muesli bar sorry guys a comment on this board that ba equals budget airline just about sums it all up i have other choices from the gulf back home and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy the choice of entertainment and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return otherwise the epitaph how the mighty have fallen springs to mind 
1715, london heathrow pisa return i fly this route often as i have a house in tuscany i fly british airways club europe only because the fas are better the lounge is a welcome benefit and if you book far ahead enough you can get a reasonable deal plus avious points that aside there is little benefits to flying say ryanair the trip started at t and the northern lounge was not for a change to busy had a fruit and coffee breakfast the options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps dripping fat all over the place some years ago ba provided some nice scrambled eggs now they don t flight left from the a terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge the plane was half full it was clean and valeted we pushed back minutes early my wife had a sort of brunch thing cheese and ham rolls she said it was ok i had a couple of gin and tonics the fa said she had never seen such an empty flight and neither had i for that matter the now chargeable food and beverages in economy went down like a lead balloon apparently i read the ba brochure on the now chargeable food and as a sales and marketing professional it was the most patronising piece of rubbish i d ever read it read as if ba were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all and goodness me the products are not cheap over a for a kit kat we landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like ryanair customers several years ago you had the air bridge now you don t the return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed this in part is due to qatar airlines operating out of pisa and their business class customers use the same facility some booze and snacks nothing edible flight delayed by minutes plane was rammed very pleasant fas afternoon tea with horrible dried out sandwiches scones that didn t look like scones on both flights the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table no legroom hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as return docked at the b terminal and had to walk miles to the trains that took us back to t terminal a all in all another disappointing experience from the world s most frugal airline 
1716, overnight flight from st lucia to gatwick efficient check in lounge at st lucia was pretty dire some snacks provided which were ok plane on time club world middle seats which were a good option for us the food options on this flight were not of the usual standard i would expect of business class the starter of melon and cucumber was poor the chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavor drinks were good some options missing as not loaded but quality generally good fa s were in the main good but some better than others i was well looked after however the fa attending to my wife lacked experience and it showed overall a good flight on the subject of baggage it would seem that few of us with priority tagged baggage received their bags quickly mine were almost last 
1717, cape town to london heathrow in an old but well kept boeing full flight flight left and arrived on time what made this flight so outstanding was the crew very attentive and enthusiastic my broken headphone was replaced within seconds of me telling one of the crew when my wife s breakfast selection was apparently not available it was rapidly located at a different section and served to her pleasant surprise 
1718, i am due to fly from tehran to vancouver via london heathrow i pre paid for my seat and their system assigned a wrong seat i called customer service times and no one helped me the get this fixed british airways customer service is the worst airline customer service i ve seen i would be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with british airways 
1719, malta to gatwick my friend arrived at the check in desk it was a long queue as the system was down to be told that she had just checked baggage in one way she had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip as for the food menu the food is so expensive and it s easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices an airline should not represent a country when it s based on profit above it s people at least ryanair etc are honest and cheap british airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole 
1720, london to larnaca sadly british airways is now a very poor quality budget airline that still thinks it is a top end carrier the aircraft are generally old shabby and dirty the staff are surly and abrupt the seating cramped and uncomfortable i am a business travelled and would prefer to fly club europe but i am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy it is a joke if the person in front reclines i can t work so how is this in any way business class 
1721, mumbai to seattle via london heathrow i don t know why i chose to fly ba a sense of nostalgia i think going to india this time i decided to go east via lhr and ba seemed a good idea i will not do so again i specifically booked all the flights through ba so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e g having to pick up baggage en route the non ba flights were arranged i discovered subsequently with non partnered airlines with no instructions or pnr s trying to find out what the pnr was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as ba checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight we can t give you a boarding pass its not a ba partnered airline but ba did all the booking blank look and total non helpfulness try in heathrow i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass similarly on the way back there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight when i got to the gate the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags the fact that no one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them essentially despite ba being the travel agent here it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do the flights out were not too bad fairly empty business class and staff were accordingly attentive aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice on the way back forget it firstly no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff it wasn t the for airline use only at the front it was row when i asked them to shift that i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space done with bad grace they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight an overnight request for a cup of tea i skipped dinner to sleep took mins the breakfast was truly awful one of the worst airline meals i have ever had the seats are tight i endorse all the concerns of the configuration i m ft but keep myself fit and i m not fat i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable yes its flat but its short and tight and lumpy lufthansa ethihad emirates singapore eva thai cathay pacific all do much better than this even delta and american airlines internationals are much better generally the ba experience is unhelpful uncomfortable and shabby i m embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services its not because they are so much cheaper than others finally i m now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns porridge and muesli what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago the last time i flew ba overall it s sad 
1722, i have flown a lot with british airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed at ba s bad reviews flew from chicago to london the plane was spotless comfortable and well presented the staff were impeccable polite and helpful in my view some of the best the only thing i would ask is that they review the food they have certainly cut their costs in particular for breakfast before landing and that was insubstantial overall they continue to impress 
1723, phoenix to london heathrow due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to heathrow which i may add both my wife and i checked twice when booking the tickets was dated th march instead of th february we checked in or tried to check in whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention we couldn t prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home the staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers no nothing could be done we enquired the cost of two economy seats home whereupon we told the two economy tickets would come to an eye watering or economy to add insult to injury we already had st class tickets booked that just needed to be re booked to the th february no chance we had no choice over a barrel scarcity value i hear you cry no we boarded to find that the flight was less than half full my wife and i were beside ourselves with anger not to the flight crew it wasn t their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves to cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible we will never fly ba again british airways the worlds biggest rip off 
1724, london heathrow to chicago o hare and my experience was wonderful there were a few problems checking in at terminal there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check in running slow never mind these things happen we were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best fast track security was fast made my way to the lounge in south terminal which was busy but i was able to find a quiet spot lots of food and drinks on offer but i stuck to water as i knew would be eating on the plane had to go to a gate in b terminal this was my first time at terminal so asked how to get to the gate very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train boarding was easy although i didn t use the priority boarding service my bad missing the announcement i paid extra so i could pre book my seat j on the upper deck and really glad i did our cabin crew were wonderful so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them the food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice i managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me there s lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of passengers so it feels very private the window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in or a k you have to climb over your neighbour s foot stool legs to get in and out of your seat j is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it s by an exit door ideal for anybody over ft there is a long not too high drawer to place items i put a pair of knee length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more and there s the overhead lockers i couldn t fault my trip out and i am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable 
1725, london heathrow to mumbai i ve been a loyal ba customer for several years but this was a journey of disappointment i was late to the airport due to delays on the train line called customer services while on my way and after min of wait i was told they couldn t do anything about it but gave me the number of the airport it was incorrect at terminal i asked the attendant for help given the rush he was quite rude and said i had to join the queue unless i was flying business at the gate we had a late boarding because the computer wasn t working i was flying premium economy and let me say on this flight ba it is like the economy class of several other airlines plus this was in desperate need of a refurbishment my headrest was hanging down the seat the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn t stay in position the flight attendant who i never saw smiling for the entire flight said he had reported it on the way in i asked to change my seat in my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops it wasn t the headphones i tried mine too the entertainment system was poor it started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing plus the noise cancelling headphones are not noise cancelling try pulling the jack out and it doesn t make a difference overall a very poor experience crowned by a terrible breakfast sorry ba but you are stuck in the s and you re slipping further down my list of preferences 
1726, san jose costa rica to london gatwick we were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check in the next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused i argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights after about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together i later found out the two ba employees travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually after a great deal of argument moved i have complained to ba and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn t in the future next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight my ife didnt work they offered to move me ironically to swap with one of the ba employees but i declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal dreadful stressful experience for people who d paid a lot of money have been called by customer service who have offered us avios as compensation enough for a night at the holiday inn express awful company to deal with totally dismissive of customer need on the plus side business class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive ba need to do better though far better if they are to compete with the good middle east and far eastern airlines 
1727, amman to london heathrow staff were very minimalistic in their service they were not rude but not willing to be helpful or go out of their way to make a good impression i fly very often not often with ba so thought i d try it and now realized they do not compare with other major airlines 
1728, london heathrow to miami i paid extra for an exit seat this is the best thing to do make sure you get the one closest to window mainly because no one stands there to stretch their legs etc you get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander stretch whenever you want and it is good value on a ten hour flight the seats on the a are narrow the entertainment system the usual etc the meals were fine my major issue with british airways economy is their penny pinching you sit down there is no welcome snack you then have your meal and seven hours later if you are hungry you have to pay for basic snacks it s ridiculous on american airlines they put out boxes of pretzels biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to if you have a diet coke on american you get a full ml can on british airways you get the small version there are so few differences flying in economy between different airlines these things count ba has no other major advantages so sadly why use them 
1729, lisbon to london heathrow now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights they might as well rebrand to a budget airline over the last few years leg room across european flights business and economy class has decreased to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline that said it is in practice worse than budget airlines because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button eliminating further discomfort even without the seat in front reclined anyone taller than will be packed in tightly on any european short haul flight the staff are friendly and polite however they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks food sales service especially when the plane is full and the flight is under hours mins this does not only result in thirsty hungry customers but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets business class which i sometimes use is offered a free meal and drinks all of a reasonable quality however in terms of legroom seat size there is no benefit compared to economy the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me otherwise i get little in the way of added value the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it in monetary terms particularly if one mostly flies within europe it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership many are valid for most european and beyond airports rather than remain loyal to ba these days i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now on a monthly basis my sympathies go to the staff because i fear cost cutting will get them next which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day 
1730, berlin tegel to london heathrow i decided to give british airways a chance for a short weekend trip to london because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low cost airlines and what do you know i had a part of the low cost experience paying a bigger price no checked in luggage included not even as a oneworld emerald and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages a plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good the prices were even below airport ones the bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products people were buying stuff and it took ages until you could get your order well you can t compete with ryanair trying to do better the things they do best i really miss the days when british airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack it was a pleasure to fly with them and i would be happy to get back to those days some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule boarding was very efficient which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous a lot of space very comfortable leather seats as an advice please don t try to be someone else stay where british airways used to be and the success will come losing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free 
1731, istanbul to london heathrow i am a frequent flyer between turkey and canada i got first time flight by british airways i feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for hour flight from istanbul to london they explained it by economical concerns what is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water also from london to vancouver we delayed almost hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane which could be understandable this part but the plane was old boeing the screens were very bad quality and small the name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than average cabin crew are professional though so this is not their mistake it was enough trouble for me not to select ba in my flights in the future 
1732, filthy dirty tired boeing to chicago british airways first class seat is barely a business class seat on other airlines food absolutely terrible and service from crew hurried and disinterested ife movies limited selection and slow this is an airline in decline they don t care because of limited competition across the atlantic in summary not first class but rather no class finally their first class lounge at heathrow was dirty and worn 
1733, london heathrow to bangkok as you walk into heathrow t you have the feeling of a world class airline and that s where it stopped minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up it took them hour to fix the plane didn t tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags i gave up my seat d for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so i got d big mistake seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and i heard her say to a co worker that s the last of her problems it was the coldest plane i have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets i was that cold i took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight they had to manually reset everyone s screens they were very old the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag the interior on the seating was old and lumpy i m sitting here writing this hours later and my backside is still raw they don t even have usb s to charge your phone so they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any usb charge points around the plane going to email ba and ask for a refund on my return ticket as i can honestly say out of the or so airlines i have flown on over the years this is by far the worst 
1734, gatwick to cape town this journey was a very pleasant surprise i didn t expect great service and was not disappointed i didn t expect great food or wine and was not disappointed i didn t expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised this was an older with a configuration seat pitch in economy and comfortable seats i flew to south africa this time last year with virgin on their new b and it was a nightmare the comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than i had expected 
1735, toronto to london in premium economy easy check in and fast track security meant i was in the lounge within mins unfortunately they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it s last legs i let the front desk know and the staff made me a fresh sandwich also beers had changed with lagers and newcastle brown the manager fetched some ipa from the first lounge some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge the most disorganised boarding ever with few pas onboard juice or water offered i asked for sparking wine but it s only done on flights from london crew explained it can t be chilled at outstations poor excuse given they do it for club and first fast service after take off with an ok entree poor salad and a nasty dry piece of cake ife was the same as my trip over christmas so it seems the ife is updated less often tea coffee and juice offered before landing but no muffin or even a biscuit really poor prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt return a week later was a better flight easy check in again and no fast track queue north lounge was an average experience ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh bused to aircraft a boeing with premium economy only half full a half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service an ok meal with a rancid coleslaw ok steak and a tiny pot of desert generous with the drinks unfortunately the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by ba i was offered t cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger the crew were genuinely embarrassed a couple of sandwiches i liberated from the club lounge made up for it fast off the plane and despite slow immigration the bags beat me again overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors the meal is nowhere near club standard and its the cutting of the small things nibbles breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most be competitive but don t take it out on me i wouldn t mind but the prices don t go down with the reduction of service despite what the ceo maintains it is not in response to customer feedback ba need to listen to what we re saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlines eventually the hardiest of us loyal ba customers will give up and move airline alliance and that would be a shame 
1736, london heathrow to stuttgart fly in comfort and style is the slogan of british airways but there is not much of either around these days not willing to pay an extra i was allocated a middle seat right at the rear at the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand luggage at no extra cost within a minute a burly employee told me i had to check in my cabin bag saying you should not believe what is said on the company s website how very true some ten other passengers equally perplexed suffered the same fate i know there were ten because another employee kept counting us and saying we need ten the burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags all in all a demeaning experience the seat rows are now more tightly packed than before although of average slim build i found the seat a tight fit only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink the deceptive upgrade we were sold at the beginning of the year but still did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers on the return journey i noticed part of the reason for this new policy the stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff ba is now no better than the no frills competitors but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices a loyal customer of many many years i will choose their competitors in future 
1737, london heathrow to las vegas and a great journey the flight was on time and staff were professional and friendly the inflight meals were tasty and the portions of a good size although the seats are a bit narrow they were comfortable and the leg room was adequate facilities on the plane were clean would definitely fly ba again 
1738, london heathrow to rome return race to the bottom my first time with the new buy onboard service i was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment basically it does not work i can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options i would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks even soft drinks are chargeable i don t think this is acceptable however despite the extensive menu there was an extremely limited selection available one crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food there was a minute wait time for this the crew then came around with the drinks trolley this was extremely slow the payments could only be made with credit cards or avios points the payment added significant times to process despite sitting rows from the front of the cabin we didn t get our drinks until minutes after they started there was only the one trolley and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent ceo alex cruz and british airways your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom more rows in economy abreast in some s and other cost cutting measures mean that even though i m a silver exec club member i am now considering my future travel options i live near manchester airport and klm air france and lufthansa are more attractive options 
1739, edinburgh to london city despite having a confirmed booking when i attempted to check in with a prepaid for bag at at the edi airport for a flight to lcy domestic flight i was told i couldn t as the flight had been oversold i accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn t be authorised so i had to wait i then stood around for minutes being asked to move out of the way at one point because i was blocking others i was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details despite what the ba website claims should be done and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves i was simply ignored until i approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor none was available nor could be contacted apparently i wasn t allowed to transfer to the flybe flight in case a seat became available on my original flight so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in i was told to wait for another minutes i argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given i had a confirmed booking in the first place but i was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it s not their problem that other people had checked in before me i was treated as a nuisance at one point there were members of ba check in staff doing nothing nobody else to serve whilst i was just standing silently there waiting and being ignored after minutes of not knowing what to do my original flight closed and i was approached by a supervisor who suddenly was available to talk to me and given a seat i asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier i had been told the flight was already full with no seats available he explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in and as the check in was closing they could give me the seat now i informed him that i resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings i had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily like a problem rather than a customer i then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure i was not denied boarding at the gate for being late even though i had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally especially for a domestic flight as i told the supervisor if the airline treats its customers with such contempt do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt under their current policy of overbooking passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all even though they have a confirmed booking some would call this cheating the saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual and unlike mainline ba this route is run by its subsidiary ba cityflyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient i rate it out of for the stress incurred in checking in 
1740, accra to london heathrow on ba is a hr min overnight flight sleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself bit i was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing we had just entered french airspace all cabin lights were put on bright for the breakfast snack service following the dinner after take of in accra the more since this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee or cold drink only not even a biscuit was offered i was shocked 
1741, this a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to business class passengers we were flying to mauritius on holiday and i felt given the flying time we should spoil ourselves and fly up front with all the comparative comfort of business class the british airways flight itself was okay the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine however i was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the gatwick lounge a small issue for some perhaps but for me it s all part of the business class experience to illustrate my point i attach a shot of what walsh s policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare paying passengers with the very confusing layout that greets one in the south terminal now that ba have moved in the serve yourself check in you even label your own bags i was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the lounge but then to be greeted with this was totally unacceptable so willie rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders this sort of display of overt cost cutting has now lost you revenue for the future short sighted management or what take a lesson from emirates who i decided to fly home with so disgusted was i over our experience they put passengers first 
1742, london heathrow to vancouver return both flights were punctual but sadly the aircraft used are now beginning to look their plus years of age especially compared to the a s ba have used on this route the cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a hour flight i was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room the ife system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings on the plus side the cabin staff were friendly helpful and courteous and this is somewhere ba seem to do well food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class boarding at yvr was very well organised less so at the heathrow end it is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped terminal at heathrow overall a reasonable experience but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish 
1743, return trip from washington dulles to london heathrow flight was barely a quarter full going to washington flight was probably only about a third full attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen given that i was on an a it really did look empty food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner i d flown on i was given an exit row seat which was very welcome ba usually charge for this seat it meant about foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet no real gripes although the snack served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny twix chocolate and a cup of coffee flight cost and using some airmiles i knocked this down to loads of interactive channels to watch but films weren t the best but that s a personal thing 
1744, bangkok to london with british airways i m a frequent flyer for a change we decided to fly ba to london from thailand for our hour journey when we were seated we realized that the seat cushion was coming away underneath there were lots of litter we then realized that we can t watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound i informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc our other complaint was the food it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times in short i would not recommend flying with ba 
1745, london to hong kong with british airways the flight is good as i booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying ba to get this best seat k other seats are below standard for long haul business yet a similar seat on an a is better service is good and food is adequate i fly this route many times on ba rather than cx cx is better but ba better priced and that is if you get the best seat points for b and for a 
1746, flying british airways from paris to london is less convenient as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located one floor down at basement but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the cathay pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengers boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour not ba s fault the pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate car the flight is ok with snack and drink 
1747, chicago to london heathrow don t waste your money buying ba seat assignments in advance i did that a month ago at the same time as i made my booking and paid for an aisle seat of my choice when i went back one week before my journey my aisle seat was gone and i was placed in an undesirable middle seat there was no remedy for this five calls over three days to ba connected me to people in delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately sorry and just no i have been deceived lied to and put off i have flown british many times this is absolutely my last time it is acceptable to make an error but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it take my advice choose another airline i am a oneworld emerald flyer on aa flew k miles last year and i can tell good service from bad british airways has unfortunately declined badly 
1748, the quality of british airways has most certainly gone downhill on short haul from london heathrow to rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet online check in was quick and easy and terminal is a delight however online check in is only available hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in days prior to departure that was the only good part of our journey we boarded a packed old which was decaying with the middle seat e so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight we were in row without notice we had to go through de icing which meant a min delay to our service we did however catch up mins our inbound flight was on a newer a which had better seats and a skymap due to slot restrictions at rome and london this flight was also delayed during both flights the new buy on board was poorly done taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service what a shame 
1749, london heathrow to brussels living in england for months i d cided to go back home for a week i am terrifying about flying but choose to do it by plane anyway i am happy to have chosen ba in the airport at the gate in the plane i felt safe and people listen to me i had the chance the two times going and back to meet the captain in the cockpit to feel better the crew was nice and friendly and thanks to them i had a comfortable flight and i am now ready to take it again the planes were clean and nice
1750, my partner and i flew dublin to seattle via london heathrow with british airways heathrow to seattle was on a b which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped making it impossible to sleep on a hr flight online check in wasn t possible and we weren t able to select our seats as our booking had an iberia flight number even though it was operated by ba made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and i didn t get our seats together ground staff could do nothing about it luckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on board food was bland to say the least possibly the worse on any carrier i ve ever flown with however service provided by cabin crew was excellent would only fly ba again for this 
1751, the whole experience was poor flying from london heathrow to athens ancient aircraft poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of products on short haul and athens at hours is classified as this ba is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carriers the sole advantage is that they fly to from major airports this airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer base deserts them for alternative airlines 
1752, doha to london heathrow having flown into doha with qatar airways the flight with british airways was a shock for a start the club world seats are not comfortable there is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces the cabin crew were indifferent we departed at approximately am immediately on reaching cruising altitude we were informed that they were now serving lunch at am we were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent this on a hour flight a cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early i don t know what timezone lunch was in possibly bangkok but certainly not doha or london time after hours i rang the bell the female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously did you ring the bell yes once the entire flight i asked for the sandwich and she told me that i would have to wait no i want it now not a five course meal a sandwich having just flown on qatar airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time apparently a pre prepared sandwich was a big ask in business class i was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight i did complain immediately to ba and to their credit i received a response basically they were sorry i felt this way never again pay a fortune for this basic service 
1753, will never touch british airways again having flown ba on this route from orlando to london heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill when i went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack i was told i had to buy them having paid over for my tickets i replied i m not doing that i ve paid enough for this flight already to which the cabin manager replied well thats just the way the industry is going people want value for money and this is how you get it all the airlines are doing it if you don t like it tough i have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life as well as this the seats were old and the screens didn t work other airlines namely air new zealand singapore airlines even american in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money you even still get snacks on long haul flights i guess all the airlines are doing it right 
1754, leeds bradford to heathrow service is equal to ryanair and easyjet i ve been flying with ba regularly for last years and i can t get my head around what is going on complimentary drinks replaced with a buy on board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now really just appalling there is no competition on the lba route but i certainly won t pay anything extra to travel with ba from now on if there are alternatives available ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually 
1755, vienna to los angeles via london on at pm the night before my flight i received an email saying that my first leg to london had been cancelled and i needed to call to reschedule on the phone the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day i could take on the st i said great book that he did and i received the conformation and noticed that the flight was scheduled for i told him and he said oh yes that was an error on our part however to book this he gave up my other seat i told him this was his mistake and he needed to fix it he said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which would be useless as it was k to buy a new ticket or i could fly out on i asked if british airways would comp my hotel for their mistake he said no and i asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for more nights he had no answer he refused to book me on any other airline i asked for a manager he said there were none available i fought with ba from pm until am no exaggeration i have screeenshots of the phone calls i decided to get up at am go to the airport and talk with a ba rep only to find out they have no ba reps but a rep representing a ba rep she told me at first she could do nothing either and i told her i did not care where in the us she got me just get me to the us she managed to get me a flight to philadelphia the next day she comp d my hotel for the night and all meals as a business who has inconvenienced me should however she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and i had to individually check in to each one the check in associate also failed to do so therefore when the stewardess for airberlin was minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit i had to run to the next gate only to find out i wasn t checked in so they gave my seat away i begged and pleaded and cried and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seat upon arrival into the us i was so grateful until i found out my bag was left in dusseldorf it took another weeks to get it back at the end of it ba left me in a deficit had to get home to ca from philly i contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldn t do anything for me next time i will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and i know will not screw me over lufthansa for example treated me so well and i wasn t even a paying customer 
1756, london heathrow to innsbruck i have been a loyal customer of british airways for years if ever i had a choice between them and another airline i chose british airways but no more the new food and drink service is appalling the crew on our flight never made it to the last or so rows so my children sat at the back went thirsty this was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere clearly that is not ba s fault but it is their fault that i couldn t then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane next time i will fly ryanair i doubt we ll notice any difference 
1757, los angeles to london heathrow starting with being charged to check my hold luggage despite on the outbound sectors being able to check in hold luggage for free the onboard service continues to decline for passengers in ba world traveller terrible food minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine you get the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the bare minimum you will be restrained and arrested on arrival at your destination seat was okay better comfort than american airlines i have to say but the movie selection and tv selection was poor as usual with random selections of tv programmes which are interrupted continually by onboard announcements the new ba ceo is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into their low cost subsidiary vueling 
1758, gatwick to barcelona unimpressed with the new m s on board service boarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags quite a few were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bags overhead i had to put my bag much behind my row it s not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines but sadly i booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard 
1759, london heathrow to rio de janeiro minute delay on the tarmac air conditioning wasn t working during delay would only work once engines were on the cabin was therefore unbearably hot the foam in my seat b had deteriorated to the point i could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone i informed the cabin staff of this but due to the flight being overbooked i couldn t be moved and so i was given an extra pillow this is a hour flight and i don t think this is acceptable i was very uncomfortable during this flight in flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating blipping in flight snacks now have to be paid for considering the price of flights i think this is very poor british airways is not a budget airline in fact airlines currently rated lower than ba in the top airlines eg virgin atlantic and malaysian airlines still provide complimentary on board snacks there were two in flight meals on this flight on both occasions i was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out once i could forgive but twice when i complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when i had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for hours the steward informed me that i was travelling to a poor country and i should be grateful for the food i was getting how rude i do not book flights with ba to get lectured by your flight staff the quality of the meals have dropped dramatically no crackers or cheese no fruit what is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake both of which i intensely dislike this is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting i d had no choice in your menu and what was served up was unpalatable i have to take medication that needs to be taken with food i had no choice but to purchase food on board an additional charge on an already expensive flight is a hard pill to swallow 
1760, london heathrow to new york paid to pre book my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat before we even left ba changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us luckily i spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat to cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo on complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund i was told they are always doing this on returning back to the uk on christmas eve i contacted customer service and was told i would receive a refund i took the customer services operators name and id number no refund i completed the on line complaints form i received an acknowledgment nothing happened i wrote to the chief executive no acknowledgement nothing i wrote to the refunds department no acknowledgement nothing i chased customer services again and was told the refund department is so busy i will never fly with ba again to quote british airway customers service response i completely understand why you re unhappy you didn t get your preferred seats i apologise for the inconvenience caused to you i hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon my response was that i don t think so 
1761, flew british airways economy from tampa to athens and back via london gatwick outbound and london heathrow inbound the boeing outbound was a bit scruffy but overall a good experience the new ife had been installed on the inbound aircraft but moving map inoperable and seemed to have been loaded with very few movies and tv options crew excellent on all flights i continue to favor ba for long trips they really work hard the seat rests do not come up all the way but this was the only annoyance not sure if i like the new charges for food on the european legs gbp was steep for coffee and tea in plastic cups 
1762, hong kong to london on an a in business class i like the upper deck cabin and at my preferred seat with complete privacy the food is adequate of large quantity though not superior quality drinks are served generously has good arrival lounge at lhr a necessity as flight arrives at am 
1763, my mother who is years old who is not too well and myself booked business class tickets on ba to istanbul on th jan and requested disabled person assistance for my mother the flight got cancelled due to bad weather at ist this is understood but when we tried to reschedule the flight we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as istanbul airport was shut due to snow we nearly got rebooked on a flight to munich which we refused as ba ticketing agent did not know that the turkish incoming flight to munich was cancelled i had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to munich where we would have got stranded in total we were stranded at heathrow for hours and managed after that to fly to istanbul via athens on aegean airlines at and the next day from athens being delayed by nearly hours when finally we got the option to travel via athens we had to go and collect our luggage when we asked for the pre arranged assistance for my mother we were told no assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help we had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from ba s lounge at t we went to what was marked as luggage desk club word were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled when asked for transport to t a train was offered which links the terminals had to take a taxi at a cost of to get to t i asked for a refund of part of the ticket i received a general reply without any joy british airways need to look around you and learn from other airlines i was surprised with the standards of aegean airlines so pleasant staff clean aircraft the comfort of the seat and quality of the food all which are missing with ba 
1764, london heathrow to berlin tegel a good flight food is good for a short haul flight in business class but i note that there is no longer free snack and drink in economy now they sell m s stuff but the question is whether it is worth the while flying business short haul i did only because it is one of my long haul segments i expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation 
1765, gatwick to salzburg return in business class and these were pleasant flights with both flights arriving early the flight out was early morning so a hot breakfast was provided with champagne on the flight back afternoon tea was provided rather than lunch which was odd for a flight leaving at local time 
1766, gatwick to barbados outbound on th january and returning nd february over many years and travelling to many parts of the world our last flight was a eye opener to see what bean counters can do to ruin a airlines reputation please british airways you need improve 
1767, bordeaux to london gatwick as a former executive gold card holder years running my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status back to blue i have just started flying again with british airways and just recently the bordeaux to gatwick route once served by a and now replaced by the more modern a to my surprise the cabin looks very nice although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of ryanair and has a pleasant feeling sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now economy but the wines are not good i am a wine trade professional if the food is m s concept why don t they get m s to supply them the wines too years ago the selection process at british airways was different and the wines were then great but overall my flight to gatwick was enjoyable the crew professional and hardly more expensive than easyjet on the same route my next ba trip is on february th this time to shanghai i am concerned though to read the generally appalling comments about ba s long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight in economy i hope ba is taking these comments onboard seriously 
1768, london heathrow to san francisco return upgraded from premium economy to business on outward leg and business as booked on return both legs on the a which is a super plane spacious comfortable and clean entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older s both flights were very good with attentive friendly cabin crew and excellent food my only complaint was that the inbound flight was minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flight ba should never book connections with such a tight schedule problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff especially a ba manager at t who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helping to pay his wages 
1769, aberdeen to paris via london heathrow british airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a well marketed and poorly executed scheme of m s tie up on catering in european and domestic routes ba is where a passenger has to remain thirsty for even a hr flight to far europe destination without a credit or debit card leave alone any complimentary drink even a cup of water is charged no cash accepted stooped to lowest levels of customer service from being a renowned airline i will evaluate all other options before travelling ba in domestic and european routes although i am a bronze member 
1770, london heathrow to copenhagen my first time experiencing british airways buy on board service this must be brand suicide at its worst how ba can go from a full service carrier to low cost overnight is astounding the brand is now cheapened the offering before wasn t gourmet but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit now you can t even get hot water for free even sas offer a complimentary coffee what ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by british airways in every single class you travel yet you don t see a decrease in ticket prices the positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly but i do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them 
1771, london heathrow to washington dulles my first long haul flight with british airways flight on time quite new and spotless aircraft very friendly and efficient cabin crew descent lunch followed by the snack served hour prior to landing good choice of drinks and soft drinks informative cockpit crew wide choice of ife cons limited legroom in economy additionally limited by the electronix box beneath the seat overall i am impressed decent value for the money paid i would definitely fly with ba again 
1772, heathrow to hong kong in business class on rd january as part of a holiday to new zealand also involving flights with cathay pacific and malaysia airlines the flight to hong kong with british airways showed up all that is bad about british airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines the continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight check in at terminal was chaotic there having been a computer glitch which greatly slowed the check in and bag drop processes there were too few ba staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed business check in was better but still very busy ba needs to speed up bag drop urgently other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily the lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture used dishes not being cleared too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability not a great place to rest before an hour journey and i would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards compare this to the other home lounges of other carriers such as those at hong kong and kuala lumpur took a shower whilst waiting and that was ok the flight was not good at all cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing gone are all the small and not so small touches that made flying with ba a pleasure such as hanging up coats hot towels a second round of drinks a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after a comment about the seats how can ba justify across in business class when the ying yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution but a lot of other airlines now only have across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don t have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping i had a window seat and i felt very hemmed in there was no storage space for the things you need during a flight glasses tablet computer water bottle etc all were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat sadly ba is no longer my airline of choice i spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the union flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home i saved a considerable number of avios points for my retirement which i am now using up but on other airlines within the one world alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted sorry ba but you ve lost my loyalty club world is now very poor and also club europe now and you ve lost the plot to the bean counters never thought i d say this but i ve joined the abba club anybody but ba 
1773, gatwick to mauritius return absolutely fine from online check in baggage drop at gatwick to collecting baggage in mauritius allocated seats together passengers given at online check in with no need to change these pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly boeing about years old but still in presentable condition i m m tall and medium build and i found the seat pretty comfortable for a hour flight in economy at least this aircraft type is still abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin not the largest seat screen i ve experienced but fine and there was a reasonable selection of movies tv and music drinks service followed by hot meal roast chicken in sauce or veggie option we ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldn t really fault what was provided lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served cabin crew friendly and efficient service with water service through the night plus option to get drinks from the galley landed on time spent ages in the queue at immigration luggage waiting for us and then taxi to hotel we got there safely on time and in reasonable comfort return flight a week later pretty much the same as outbound 
1774, flew from los angeles to nice via london heathrow words travel nightmare every leg of my british airways flight was delayed including one which was delayed due to a paperwork issue that would take minutes hours later we took off late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which british airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a hour line to rebook inflight entertainment audio system did not work properly which was not resolved and offered no compensation as a result by far the worst travel my wife or i have ever experienced we will be avoiding this airline for life 
1775, zurich to london heathrow and my first trip on ba since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellers this is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no training okay it might not be easy for them but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer questions about the new ryanair style service and a lot of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something i am sick and tired of the ceo of ba telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked for be honest and accept that this is a ploy to enhance your personal bonus at the end of year and keep shareholders happy that said it seems the ba reputation is on the slide across many markets and that s where shareholders should be truly worried and no i sold my ba shares many years ago 
1776, gatwick to barcelona return and just dreadful pretty much sums up this british airways business class experience since ba moved to gatwick south terminal their new lounge is still not ready they re currently using the clubrooms and the old virgin atlantic lounge now called the speedbird lounge gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first class use the clubrooms what a sorry state this lounge was full with limited seating a forty minute wait for food no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets i left as hungry and thirsty as i arrived no to worry though british airways will feed me onboard once onboard for a two hour flight i was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches a scone and a really small slice of cake this meal was completely insufficient there was one drinks round offered and one top up offered given that ba use the smallest glasses possible coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade you will be thirsty i found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend after being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in galley 
1777, sofia to london heathrow the flight was on time but british airways has slipped to low budget airline standards i ve been using ba for many years but my next holiday is booked on another airline i cannot score more than even for cabin crew as i didn t receive any service onboard almost hour flight and not one question or moment of attention from the cabin crew you receive attention only if you ask to buy something from them food water etc crew is not guilty they are victims of the new airline policies ba just lost it s class 
1778, washington to barcelona return via london premium economy transatlantic economy on short haul comfortable flights and first rate cabin service both ways a late departure from bcn on the return trip due to fog in london was largely made up for and i made my connection to washington with time to spare also my checked bag did not make it on the original flight to barcelona but a claim was put in for and my bag was delivered to my hotel the following morning concerning the m s food and drink service on european sectors i don t normally eat on short hauls but i did note that one of the drinks on offer in this service is my favourite ale old speckled hen not previously seen by me on an airline i paid with avios i don t enjoy having to pay for something that was once available for free but sometimes there are compensations ba is still my first choice for international travel and get me to from my destination in comfort and with attentive friendly service 
1779, vancouver to london heathrow and i was really really hoping that british airways had refurbished the interior of the boeing i was flying on sadly this was not the case the seats were uncomfortable and the video screens were about half the size of an ipad and definitely looked as if they were years old the service was great and flight attendants would pass by regularly with refreshments 
1780, london heathrow to milan return how british airways have fallen in their service and product they are no better than ryanair now and frankly unless lhr is convenient to you i would seek another airline not even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offered seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything i checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that i immediately ripped off the only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant i got early boarding this is my last trip through lhr as the connection procedure is so awful american airlines are now better than british airways and that says it all 
1781, flew british airways from london gatwick to bridge town flight good staff attentive inflight food shocking second year running no choice just a pasta the whole meal was economy with a big e i doubt the whole tray cost gbp the only other food was a coffee and the world s smallest kitkat for an eight hour flight appalling ba should be ashamed and or put another ten pounds on the ticket and give a proper meal have flown virgin thomas cook etc outstandingly ba the worst fly virgin 
1782, how the mighty have fallen or should i say continue to fall my partner and i booked tickets from london to johannesburg back in september we paid approx for the economy tickets slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats it was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats so it was placed some feet further down the aircraft not life threatening just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag we were surprised about the lack of space our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced here is your vegetable lasagne rather than explaining that for our they were not able to offer us the default evening meal chicken or beef as they had ran out of these they made no effort to remedy the situation whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn t happy with a vegetable lasagne so i had no meal as a result as i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedback on the flight i took the time to respond explaining all the above but received no response whilst i was in johannesburg i tried to contact call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at ba is like trying to get an audience with pope francis i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn t qualify for any redress i then challenged this i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft would i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight no and would ba if they were reasonable expect me to pay the full cost in summary i eventually was offered credit off my next ba flight totally unacceptable as i don t fly that often even shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it s onboard service and the same for it s customer relations which arrogantly doesn t give a damn looking back the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me 
1783, london heathrow to zurich because of fog in morning at heathrow i have called ba and checked online for delays of my late afternoon flight i was told several times that the flight was on time after a disorganized boarding the door of the aircraft was closed minutes late then the captain informed us about a minutes delay of departure because of fog in the morning at heathrow airport at the end we arrived with hours delay in zurich when airborne we were informed about the new catering concept of british airways for economy class passengers on european flights you have to pay for food and the drinks thanks to the delay we spent more then two and a half hour on a ba plane and we did not receive a free glass of water 
1784, madrid to london fairly chaotic check in largely down to the iberia staff boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards cabin was reasonably clean flight crew gave good information inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales and this was where the chaos started the time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating i was seated rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off before landing i spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them this was not a cheap fare that i got and british airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service buy onboard etc what a lie i have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before ba stopped any complimentary service sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of lufthansa and air france 
1785, london heathrow to philadelphia return very good experience both flights mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service very energetic younger crew on return where everything happened quickly and efficiently both crews friendly and had control of the cabin which made for a relaxed atmosphere food noticeably better than of late i hope this will continue on return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog but rebooking had been done by the time i checked in in phl and i had a text message also to that effect concorde room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much all in all good solid enjoyable flights i would add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive 
1786, the decline of british airways my review is primarily on ba euro traveller in economy up to two years ago one felt good when travelling ba they were miles ahead of budget airlines yes they were a bit more expensive but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage checked in cases of kg all part of the service today ba provides no free food or beverage and require extra payment for check in luggage today within europe ba has absolutely no advantage opposite easyjet norwegian monarch or even ryanair why should anyone pay extra for ba they have lost absolutely their unique selling points incidentally coming back from malta to london gatwick in ba in business class there is nowhere to hang coats previously ba flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard and now no cupboards extra seats instead the decline and fall of a once proud ba in future ba will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines 
1787, i was returning home for my wedding on december connecting to british airways from london heathrow to abuja the seat i had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet i never got an explanation for this action however i wasn t very fussy about this as i was very excited to be getting married also the flight was dirty the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place our flight arrived at the abuja airport and i was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within nigeria i went to claim my luggage at the carousel i waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and i couldn t find my luggage which had my wedding items in it including my wedding dress as you can imagine i was devastated i had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue i spent the night at abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one ba flight arrives from heathrow to abuja each day my luggage never arrived the next day myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items the ba staff at the airport weren t helpful at all they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was my luggage finally arrived about days after my wedding in a very bad shape up till this day ba has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven t refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them ba ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and i have vowed to never fly with ba 
1788, london heathrow to cape town return having previously flown ba first class on the boeing and a this trip on an ageing boeing from heathrow terminal was disappointing the sooner ba replace these aircraft the better i had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats which looked more like ba s dreadful club world seats the first disappointment came after pre booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying we would get a club world meal instead why there are only first class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few avios as compensation the ife screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good the good thing was that we had excellent ladies serving in our cabin ba need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition priority boarding is a joke anybody with a bronze executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate priorities need re assessing and controlling special needs and first class passengers first and then trickle down from there they also need to maintain the aircraft to a better standard or replace them more quickly 
1789, london heathrow to chicago in first with british airways it was better than my last trip in club world but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around asia not with ba one quickly realises how sub par most of the ba experience has become airport service at heathrow distinctly average and economy style onboard some staff friendly some surly and frankly lazy loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight while i don t fly to dine this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines and cost saving is clearly evident ife was okay trouble is there is no proper competition on this route as us carriers can t be classified in the first class league 
1790, san francisco to johannesburg via london the two flights were as different as night and day both night flights so the idea was to get as much sleep as possible sfo lhr ba th january was a full business class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants perfect mix of professionalism friendliness and efficiency although the boeing had seen better days they had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep lhr jnb ba on th january was an absolute disgrace great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service these attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took hours this on a night flight post take off drinks were served relatively quickly there was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken and a further huge gap between the meal service being started all the while being delivered by the most miserable steward i ve ever had the displeasure to encounter being a gold card holder the csm who was a delight came to give me her personal welcome and i did feedback about my experience she acknowledged that these new crews are inexperienced and i said that s no excuse for rudeness why can ba not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service later had the pleasure of flying jnb cpt on comair a ba franchise in south africa what a great little airline again very young crew but an absolute delight overall i give the journey a but my breakdown would be sfo lhr lhr jnb jnb cpt i ve checked the recommend box but if you are on a night flight with the new contract crew avoid them
1791, we flew from heathrow to larnaca return the aeroplane was old and tired uncomfortable seats overhead tv screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had chose my headphones did not work in the seat either but apart from it being a somewhat ok ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking we can only choose food and drink from a marks and spencer s booklet believe me the food is not up to m s quality they should never have put their good name behind this ba endeavour to cut costs whilst i accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful what on earth are ba thinking about british airways are seriously letting themselves down badly we felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets indeed if we had flown with easyjet or ryanair we would have saved ourselves hundreds of pounds i will certainly be seeking out other airlines for our frequent bookings to cyprus which amounts to at least or trips a year m s don t spoil your good reputation with this venture 
1792, flew economy from london to manchester in august the service was really good even for this short flight the crew were smiley the food offered was okay before ba discontinued free food and drinks in and the flight departed on time london heathrow t was good and the queues weren t too long even though it was peak summer time 
1793, we flew british airways from lisbon to san jose via london lisbon to london the seats were ok basically coach seats but the middle seat is blocked off the crew on that flight was very good we were a bit apprehensive about the configuration of seats on the long haul boeing from london to san jose i had a middle seat e but it turned out fine but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class i did not need to go over anybody to get in and out however the other middle seats might not have been as easy staff on the london to san jose flight was good but not warm or personal the food quality was better than some airlines 
1794, london to phoenix with british airways in premium economy possibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever both outward and inward flight the plane was dirty old and smelly the cabin crew were rude unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaints british airways should stand for budget airline 
1795, flew from gatwick to tampa business class on th january the experience can only be described as appalling the business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal we had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay could use this meant it was overcrowded and dirty through no fault of the regular staff they just could not keep up with the number of passengers we could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised ba staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free the ba ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end the flight was mediocre to say the least the food was average and the service satisfactory having paid for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service we formally complained to british airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future we were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided this is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with british airways we will be travelling virgin even if it means we have to get several connecting flights to our destination 
1796, flew british airways from miami to london heathrow on th january and the aircraft was filthy in economy class pulled out the tiny tv from under the armrest and there was hair attached opened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting this has been an accumulation over a long period of time tv didn t work and after hours into a hour flight and the attendant trying to re boot it times i finally asked what could be done i had paid extra for a seat that had extra leg room seat a as there is no seat in front and you could stretch right out there was a seat free in business class but the manager on the flight made it clear that he was not allowed to move me i traveled business class on the outbound flight on rd jan but did not feel that it was value for money i will stick with emirates or virgin in the future as i know the aircraft are clean with good customer service i logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing doesn t surprise me 
1797, london heathrow to dubai and a delayed flight poor communications from lhr british airways staff horrible food crowded flight and a mars mini bite size for breakfast unmotivated crew all the money they have made seems to go to senior management a disgrace and sad to have experienced and will avoid them 
1798, never again booked a round trip from to london from paris return with british airways in business as had a separate ticket from paris to johannesburg with af in business class and cape town to paris with qatar in business class on the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in london t checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which i found strange being a business class passenger the reason i chose the ba flight was that it was from the same airport cdg as where my flight from cape town via doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing i wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to london the plan was to get refreshed in the lounge rest for few hours and get on the flight unfortunately my plans were trashed when i arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that i had been rebooked from orly which is an hour away it didn t stop there no transfer was provided and when asked how do i get there the unfriendly reply was well get a bus no indication of where the woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague tried to get some more information to which the reply was go online she gave me a paper which i thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation thought ok at least something the next shock when i arrived in orly the check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy as i was very tired and just wanted to get home agreed but asked if could still use the lounge oh no not possible at this point i was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager was told that it was not possible and that i could go online and complain gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating go online i don t care about ba when back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight complained again as had the paper from the cdg ground crew about compensation generic reply after minutes was no compensation needless to say i will never fly with ba again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who i frequently fly with in business class and am a ff luckily not of ba 
1799, not fair for the fare flew bangkok to paris via london with british airways not allowed to choose our seats the cabin was not clean lot of dust seats per row in business no privacy of the seats don t have direct access to the aisle bad meals in small portions not enough toilets tiny ptv screen and poor movie selection crew was very friendly and helpful we had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in london who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the london to paris flight we explained that we were in business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation they didn t care and refused us to bring it on board after minutes i showed that they were of a size allowed by ba they recognized their mistake and let us take it minutes of stress because they didn t do their job properly won t fly ba again except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline 
1800, glasgow to london gatwick with british airways absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight i arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the or rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin i struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight no idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly 
1801, british airways is a very good airline yesterday i was coming back from bangkok to london and i missed my flight because i feel asleep at the airport i had a sleepless night and food poisoning they did me big favour and booked next available flight next day free of charge never happened to me with another airline very impressed 
1802, london to cape town galleries lounge at t tatty and overcrowded takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues but we were kept well informed while waiting for push back seats j k on upper deck excellent for a couple although the plane was looking its age with patching up wherever you looked ife long past its due replacement date with small screen and poor resolution cabin crew friendly enough meal the usual sub standard ba fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains hotel chocolat chocs have now disappeared arrival at cpt only mins behind schedule cape town to london the galleries lounge at cpt spacious but quickly became packed with pax from two flights food options dreadful with the worst hot food we ve encountered in any business class lounge cheese pre packaged mcc available but no champagne push back mins ahead of schedule same seats on upper deck meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast arrived ahead of schedule overall the flight itself was the usual ba service onboard was another matter with seats and service way below ba s competitors and at inflated prices 
1803, in september i flew with british airways in first from london to kuala lumpur on flight ba initial impressions were positive the check in was efficient with polite and friendly staff the concorde room was a nice place to be my first suite a offered a good amount of comfort space and privacy fast forward hours would i fly in british airways first again no would i fly with british airways again no this is why on the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the first cabin with passengers the st cabin crew member was polite and professional the nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional the supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work i had to ask twice for a replacement set it took over minutes to receive this once airborne i ordered a cappuccino i had to ask three times for this and wait over minutes for it to arrive there were multiple issues with my dinner i was the second person to order my dinner yet the last person to be served it took over hours to get my dinner someone who had ordered after me got my dinner option i was told some minutes after placing my order that only one option was available it would appear that this passenger had a higher executive club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course i was only given the option of a club world main course which was delayed further as i was initially given the wrong order this delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and i was extremely disappointed at the service from the nd cabin crew member there were issues with my breakfast despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast another passenger was served first and given my breakfast i ordered a cappuccino the nd cabin crew member ignored this order when i enquired again some minutes after i had placed my order i was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore i could not have this i was extremely disappointed as at the material time i placed my order and for some time after this there had been no seat belt sign displayed the first cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight formal complaint within hours of landing in kul i wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the ceo of british airways alex cruz the you first department at british airways confirmed receipt of my email subsequently i received a very generic response from british airways customer relations no attempt was made to address or even explore the issues that gave rise to my complaint this was disappointing i was simply offered avios points i responded by return rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why i had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by british airways to address the issues that i had outlined in my formal complaint the response from british airways customer relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of avios points was because british airways have to be consistent so we re fair to all our customers i found this statement somewhat ironic 
1804, st petersburgh to london i don t know where ba got this market research to say stop complementary meals we prefer to pay for it i ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion if you want to buy something different you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding i suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true though i suspect the real reason is cost cutting ba just doesn t want to admit it ba would be better off to admit it customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good to tell me that charging for water or soft drink is a bargain when i can buy the same thing in tesco for p insults my intelligence they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market again a great image to promote to the world where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a ba passenger where any alternative exists pay extra for checked luggage pay extra for drinks pay extra for food i m sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline 
1805, british airways is a budget airline at premium airline prices flew from gatwick to cancun however if you wanted snacks on a very long flight you have to buy them on board and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry you do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight there was also nowhere to plug in laptops which you expect on a long and expensive flight especially when you have work to do the plane was also so cold too cold to concentrate on work it would take a great deal to choose them again 
1806, shanghai to zurich via london return and british airways is absolutely appalling i have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline i booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and i to go from shanghai to zurich via london on the way there the flight to zurich was cancelled due to french strike not ba s fault so that part is clear however they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled furthermore they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about hours after a hours flight to go through customs thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers find a hotel arrange our own transport there and back so the first leg already left a terrible impression then on the way back to shanghai they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and i to economy for a hour flight i booked premium economy for a reason my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy did ba care no told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat then at boarding told us sorry it s either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat because i had work the next day we had no option but to fly and ba ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap three months down the track i have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers emails to write to only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole needless to say i will forever boycott ba for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer 
1807, we travelled business class from gatwick to barbados return for christmas the outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all food crumbs around seat area stained carpets wet toilet floors etc the cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we hang it up wherever you can find space we collected our own coats prior to landing when the food was served we had been noted as not eating when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess the two hot options were unavailable i had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without the quality of the video audio was very poor the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable on the return flight the executive lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal during the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum not a very professional image on our return the only response by ba to our complaints was additional avios points an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of 
1808, well i ve checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport silly me the queue was ridiculous for bag drop and i had to spend over hours waiting to drop my bag the queue for assisted check in was far quicker i think that things got inverted now maybe quicker to check in at the airport so i was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight british airways were completely under staffed and disorganised there were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues total fail i felt i was flying with a low cost airline i kept checking the flight details for any planned delays it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow etc but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at instead of the planned departure at well that was the case until minutes before finally we got updated i doubt that this was only known at that time why wasn t there an update before anyway new departure time scheduled for we only started boarding at then inside the cabin we waited for another hour until taking off at no point did ba offer vouchers we only ate inside the cabin after am the flight was terrible but that s another story i see no point at flying with ba for a few years now staff are old and entitled when you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft you are presented with filthy dirty seats food getting worse and worse and in board entertaining almost non existent a few years ago you could actually slowly save miles nowadays you get almost nothing ba used to be good not just an ordinary lazy airline living from its glories 
1809, i paid almost to fly from london to frankfurt the flight took off and then was re routed back to london because of weather and german air space closing the communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room only to learn they still hadn t rebooked my flight while waiting in line i tried multiple times to call their customer service number and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs the rebooked flight landed hours after my original flight was supposed to land and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare london heatwave i landed almost a day later than planned but my bag didn t make it from london for another four days british airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses they d reimburse yet then denied portions of my claim the delays lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday i complained to their customer service team and after a lot of back and forth they offered a pound travel voucher such a horrible experience with this airline will never fly them again 
1810, flight from athens to heathrow delayed by minutes which seems to be the norm for this flight with ba however a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight no explanation as to the reason fortunately i was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices this was a hour flight by the way i had no idea that ba are now charging for food and drink even for water they kept that one quiet i rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring how long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as ryanair will they be selling lottery tickets next pay as you go toilet british airways still refer to themselves as the worlds favourite airline based on who s opinion exactly see no point in using ba now they usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route they have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers i fly about times annually through business and try and avoid ba with this latest money grabbing scam i will change my scheduling to avoid them there are plenty other quality carriers who like ba are struggling to maintain profits all have the same threat of terrorism fluctuating oil prices adverse weather air traffic control strikes etc but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air 
1811, we had the pleasure of flying back to the uk on the first day of ba s fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks a la sister company iberia someone please explain to me what the difference is with ryanair easyjet and norwegian now it s become a budget airline and i for one won t be using them anymore if i can avoid it they cut the avios for flights made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke i m not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a hour flight i expect ba to give me a drink then when i wanted to buy a sandwich i was told that there were only for the entire plane and they sold out salad then sold out some crisps unfortunately the person in front of me got the last bag ba you aren t iberia or air lingus stop this nonsense please take an example to klm the week before ams mad hot pasta rounds of drinks and then cake with coffee or tea and that was economy also i will avoid ba like the plague now sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits 
1812, houston to london heathrow in business class the service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight british airways used a boeing plane rather than the used on the outward journey this meant there was no upper deck seating the seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds both journeys provided a welcome drink and course menu i found i was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar i used the arrivals lounge at lhr which was great to have a shower and some breakfast 
1813, flew london gatwick to cancun in business class on a b that looked in need of a major refurbishment the cabin was drab and dated the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited the food was for business class not particularly good quality and poorly presented in particular the second meal on an hour flight was a packet of sandwiches and some cake i am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class i d have thought ba could make some effort to present the food better in summary the experience compared very badly to asian or middle eastern airlines i ve used 
1814, this latest british airways trip from london heathrow to dallas fort worth just confirms how standards are slipping background family living in usa regular leisure transatlantic flyer in the last years consistently booking for travellers on each trip regularly flying business for eastbound transatlantic leg to date transatlantic travel over years has been exclusively with british airways service has been almost consistently good or very good we may not be gold or silver members but we don t deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received original booking for outbound lhr dfw leg was booked by ba agent over the phone in the wrong category class even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade cash or airmiles at a later date subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce with consistently inconsistent responses when we eventually managed to get through the executive club customer service link just sends you round in circles a formal emailed complaint through contact us resulted in we re sorry to hear you ve had problems but no solution offered teeth gritted and traveled hour flight lhr dfw departing refreshments drinks served ish before lunch year old daughter hungry no nibbles when asked steward responded well that s cutbacks for you pre ordered child s meal arrived before standard adult meals no problem juice and water were available during the afternoon no snacks available for children for hours cutbacks luckily i had a packet of shortbread as a gift for friends in usa at cabin service tea started when i asked for daughter s pre ordered child s meal conversation with stewardess went thus why didn t you order one i did she didn t have a child s meal at lunch yes she did oh well i ll check when i ve finished serving the main cabin really we were only in the rd or th row would it have been too much effort to check then clearly yes it would and when she did check some minutes later there was no child s meal so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child s lunch very ungraciously no hint of an apology customer service customer satisfaction result continued loyalty for transatlantic flights what do you think 
1815, london to hong kong return through no fault of our own very late running bus major road accident and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus my friend and i missed our flight to hong kong on december th we thought we would be re booked on the later flight especially since we had business class tickets instead we were told by the ba official at the misnamed customer services desk that we had voluntarily missed our plane i assume that was code for it s your fault not our problem that was certainly what his attitude conveyed we were then offered options pay a supplement of to take the flight take a downgrade to premium economy without a guarantee that ba would reimburse us the difference in seat price or wait four days the ba official couldn t have been less flexible or sympathetic and ba has responded to my complaint via twitter with the same disinterest my travel companion s business class seat was a gift for her th birthday any pleasure she might have got from it and mine in giving it to her were ruined by the way we were treated on the half empty flight back on new year s eve the crew obviously didn t want to be there was barely courteous and when my friend a diabetic enquired what would be in her special meal she was told no one knew they clearly didn t care either they did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a privilege she was being granted i would have thought and expected a little more courtesy and grace especially in business class god knows how the poor souls in the back were treated i have given my preference to ba for years in order to support my home airline sadly i don t think they deserve my custom any longer so the next time we fly to asia we will take one of the gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom ba s only concern these days is profit at any price their customer service is as poor as any i ve ever come across and their corporate motto to fly to serve an embarrassing joke i ve flown with them several times a year for the last years but i won t be doing it again unless it can t possibly be avoided the saddest thing of all is that i don t think british airways will give a damn 
1816, london heathrow to prague i ve been commuting to and from work for last six and half years the only airline that takes me to london heathrow is british airways sometimes i fly there and back up to two times a week i do not eat on flights so i thought ba s decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too much however they ve managed i always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water drink my tea and go to sleep to my surprise i am not allowed to get hot water anymore in fact i am not allowed to get any water on ba shorthaul flight unless i pay even if i bring my own cup and tea or unless it s medical emergency then i could get cup of cold water for free so not only they didn t lower the fare but they also sucessfully joined budget airline bunch by charging even for water to my great regret they are the only airline that takes me to heathrow so i can t take my custom anywhere else unless i change job but if i am to fly on holiday british airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again 
1817, london heathrow to amman it was my first time to fly the a ex bmi aircraft in business class on ba and i really like the layout that feels so spacious the service was great throughout and the cabin crew were active in checking if passengers needed anything the check in queues in amman were annoying but other than that this london amman london trip reminded me of how flying used to be 
1818, london heathrow to rome return outbound with an a and inbound a boeing outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent hours delays ba did look after us well though replacement aircraft found another a and we safely arrived to destination cabin crew was very helpful and polite return on an old but still good looking b i believe they will be phased out in which has plenty of legroom and space in economy although the overhead bins are not too spacious i guess that is the way they used to be we departed and landed on time overall a good experience despite the outbound delay but i prefer airlines that are able to make safety calls to those that would not 
1819, london heathrow to miami with british airways in economy class two hours late and terrible service when able to board the flight attendants seemed too young and they did not care to anyones concerns i now see why british airways has lost it class they really don t care about the customer i can honestly say i will never fly british airways again no matter if they are the lowest priced carrier 
1820, london gatwick to barbados return we were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to barbados after take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but wasn t unduly concerned dinner was served shortly afterwards which i was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too the flight time was almost hours so we were feeling hungry hours after the main meal i was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat a small bag of crisps or small biscuits the cabin staff told me it was the new policy and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles there were not even any sandwiches for sale fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and i noticed she was carrying a sandwich i asked her where she had got it and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it no one advised us that there was only one meal in hours if so we would have bought a sandwich with us i looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backs so if your planning on travelling with british airways economy to barbados make sure you pack a sandwich return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out will be travelling with virgin next time 
1821, travelled british airways from london to kuala lumpur return had a painful hour fight as i had a window seat with a metal box in the leg room areas which meant my feet were slanted to one side throughout the flight on my way back the inflight entertainment didn t work after numerous attempts to reset by the cabin crew it still didn t work for my partner and i for the price of the ticket this was not acceptable 
1822, athens to london return entire experience was excellent although due to bad weather conditions in london my original flight was cancelled and i was rebooked on another one hours later ba compensated my first night stay i got a room upgrade and their staff kept me informed on the difficult situation the aircraft interior was clean and smart and the crew smiling polite and efficient both flights on time and the meal was average 
1823, manchester to los angeles via heathrow i m always reminded that british airways is one of the worst airlines every time i fly with them the check in service is as bad as they get they have sent my bags to heathrow even though i m going to lax i expect them to know check or at least ask where i m going to make things worse the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because i booked two separate tickets which i know for a fact that i didn t because i booked a round the world flight staff have attitude across the board poor food on long haul flights struggling to think of many ways they could be worse a real embarrassment that british airways is my country s main airline 
1824, manchester to las vegas via manchester i went to the trouble of checking in online printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport to be told that is not allowed i was told i had no option but to queue up with everybody else checking in after hour in the horrific queue i am told there is no space for a bag drop at manchester t the agent said this with empty check in desks next to her british airways disgust me with this hoop jumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet thank you for the complimentary micro bag of crisps on the delayed lhr man leg if i never see ba aa ever again it ll be too soon 
1825, miami to london business class living in london and flying international long haul flights throughout the year i have once again been disappointed by british airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins our family of four were travelling home from the christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when i was ready to sleep i attempted to recline my seat in the flat bed position my seat would not recline the flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to these are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft i notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it sadly he did not i was informed that the head purser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half hopefully his accommodations were better than mine prior to landing minutes before on a hour flight the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of ba and said he could compensate me with either or avios i informed him there was a far greater price point between premium economy vs business class understandably he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing i received a call from a ba representative and i was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation or avios i currently have avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience the food individual flight attendant service and comfort sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat not the food my comfort was not met the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin the point was to sleep 
1826, i ve flown this route sydney to london many times with other airlines and british airways is the worst they changed our seats during the fuel stop at singapore without notice without explanation the food was terrible no fruit or green vegetable to be seen cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy bumped into numerous times toilet locations on board are terrible those poor people seated right next to the wc door paid extra for reserved seats no confirmation inflight entertainment was awful really really old movies this airline trades on some nostalgic image as if they were in the s other airlines are far superior don t risk it you ll be disappointed 
1827, paris cdg to bangkok via london heathrow in business class it was my first flight with ba and probably my last one ba is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting in business class each row has seats never seen that in a recent business class and you can forget any privacy the seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet not convenient the ife screen is tiny smaller than in economy in recent airplanes the movie selection was very poor the meal was bad and quantity was very poor tiny toilets for the business class not enough 
1828, london heathrow to hong kong was the most disappointing business class experience the bottom line is that ba had business class seats in a row on this boeing from lhr to hkg the seats on ba are narrow lack privacy the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about feet cm from me and don t even dream about any storage space i couldn t find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on and i kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat the footrest had to be operated manually the entire experience was so irritating that i didn t know whether i should complain or just laugh at it i have no idea how ba can get away with this they certainly won t see me as a customer again 
1829, toronto to london return in club world on with british airways outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from world traveller plus worth the money for a decent night s sleep fast check in and fast track security at pearson meant i was in the lounge within mins excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup the lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar on time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage a glass of champagne with a top up before departure i always find boarding in club world disjointed and fragmented as crew from world traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic a fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out a well timed late breakfast meant a decent hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available priority bags beat me to the baggage belt the return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded hours before departure clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a ba silver member the flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old ba i knew and loved fast bar service done by tray and not by cart an excellent meal of roast chicken with a delicious caramel desert plated too and some decent wines the only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds two whites and no rose that said the wines were very good the cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped an early landing and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home if only ba could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout then there is a chance ba could return to it s former glory
1830, london heathrow to lima after my rave review of norwegian to california i find myself back on british airways on my regular trip to south america no delays on departure and well ordered boarding but despite the smiles british airways staff just can t quite reach out to passengers as was the norwegian experience tired grey boeing interior doesn t help either okay the rudiments of a service are there but come on who decided no alcoholic drinks served with dinner or replace the afternoon tea with a box of sickly snacks and half a tumbler of water to later serve quite a tasty lunch with just coffee or tea pokey tv screen but okay ife programme choice i suppose this is the best we can expect but with so called low cost airlines doing so much better the main carriers deserve to lose ground 
1831, on my way home on st january athens to lhr the flight ba had hours delayed departure despite the fact this ticket costs and an addition of a for a seat which later came down to and an astonishing euros for luggage the only thing that we were offered inflight was a sandwich no headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and i had a fault on the lights above the seats this airline is going down fast and i will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of ba i will try not to fly them again they are worse than ryanair at least with ryanair you know what to expect ba has the logo to fly to serve i think it should be changed to fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air 
1832, stockholm to denver via london heathrow the boeing was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution the movies were quite limited the seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated there was limited space for storage both bags and stuff in the seat pocket a blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good all and all not a bad experience but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience i flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features entertainment food and comfort 
1833, london heathrow to tehran return the check in staff could have been a little more flexible although a few friends and my baggage were overweight and eventually due to a friend getting an upgrade we managed to sort it all out i was disappointed with the lack of food provided by british airways on this flight gone are the days where you get a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight the muslim meal was really not nice at all and i should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice i was so tired however outbound and inbound i found the seats to be decent inflight entertainment was quite good too did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however british airways just don t seem to be in the same league as others such as qatar airways emirates virgin etc 
1834, cancun to london gatwick with british airways the worst breakfast i ve ever had i was looking forward to my first flight with british airways thinking that they were a leading airline in my view they are nothing special i was looking forward to a nice breakfast before landing back at gatwick from mexico we were given a cheese roll yoghurt and a cereal bar i couldn t eat the cheese roll as it was so bland ate the yoghurt and saved the cereal bar for my hour drive home okay i got a good price and flew economy but that s exactly what i got a flight that seemed to focus on economy i would be happy from now on to pay more for another airline 
1835, madrid to montreal via london heathrow coming back from my honeymoon me and my wife had our luggage misplaced and is missing over the holidays weeks of clothes in our suitcases and no one is able to give us answers to where it is or why it s missing i can t even get a hold of anyone in their offices to speak to in regards to a claim everyone says to do it online sure and how long is it going to take for someone to get back to me this is not a way to handle customers i will make sure to never fly on british airways again 
1836, having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding british airways and their first class product i was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our first class flight from lhr san on ba on their b i needn t have worried this flight was excellent on all aspects our domestic connecting flight from man lhr was delayed by hours due to fog at lhr the captain came into the gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in lhr luckily we had planned hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems passengers with tight connections at lhr were offered alternative connection options the concorde lounge in lhr t ba first class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff we had booked a cabana and spa treatments both were superb and highly recommended plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full the lounge offers a la carte dining and the food was excellentpromptly champagne and great wines were also available onboard the ba in the first cabin we had seats a k these offered great comfort for the hour flight the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it i got hours sleep good quality quilts and pillows helped this seats a or k may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than a k but this is not a negative issue the meal service was excellent dine when you want excellent choice of aperitifs wines and champagne the young cabin crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the hour flight first class seats offer good privacy probably centre seats ef and ef offer the least privacy and therefore i would avoid these where possible ba first is in a league of it s own and miles ahead of club both in the air and on the ground well done ba this really was a first class experience in every meaning of the words

1838, my family and i were flying from dubai to london on th december we had our children including our year old twin girls who were flying for the first time after an hour into the journey the twins started to cry we tried comforting them walking with them etc but couldn t stop them i went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly however it took an hour at least to serve the meal the twins continued crying as they didn t eat the main meal i went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored eventually a steward came to collect a trolley for business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help i explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits i thanked him and left the cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated tired hungry children has lost my custom and i won t be flying with ba ever again 
1839, los angeles to london heathrow and my first time flying premium economy with ba the a is a state of the art flying machine food was very tasty and vast cabin crew were friendly and kind the flight departed and arrived on time to london very nice british airways 
1840, ba from budapest on th december was delayed by fog at heathrow the captain took the trouble to broadcast a message to waiting passengers in the departure lounge he explained very succinctly about the fog delay and made sure we knew there was no guarantee about take off time he gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them he explained we need to be onboard ready to fly at a moment s notice but we could be waiting to hours we boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours late i had never known that kind of communication before with delays i would like our appreciation to be passed on to the captain and crew that day

1842, baltimore washington to london heathrow bad start for my first trip on british airways extra cost for decent seat meant nothing bought a mid cabin seat for my wife and i flight delayed hours due to mechanical problem so for the insult of paying for reasonable seats my wife and i were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft no refund just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft this caused us to miss our connecting flight to venice thereby incurring a hour wait at heathrow overall a loss of a half day thinking that ba would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights was wasted a couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided a suggestion that access to the british airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment no real remorse matter of fact responses like gee this happens a lot and good luck no customer loyalty sought dispassionate professional but not really friendly staff seemed tired and overworked at counters 
1843, london heathrow to prague as a gold exec member i was mortified to find out that as a gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seat my seat allocation may have been in the rear toilet it was that far back also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines how sad but clearly someone in charge at the moment is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice why do you think people chose british airways as they are more expensive because of the service and being like it used to be to fly without taking a picnic with you 
1844, this was a much better flight than our outward lhr bkk with british airways the staff were on the ball worked hard and always around a nice plane good ife with wide modern screen seats were fine although storage lacking compared to a food still a letdown chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy white wine good red poor breakfast scrambled eggs and steak spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible i got a decent sleep 
1845, dubai to toronto via london and i tried to check in online however this was blocked and upon enquiry to ba s unhelpful customer contact centre i was told it was a random security hold by airport authorities when i questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing eta for travel to canada when i informed her that could not be the case as i was a dual uk canadian citizen she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of ba s control the second joy i had with lovely ba and staff was at heathrow during transit as i had a hour layover i elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at t arrivals upon entering departures i was stopped by one of ba senior managers who forced me to check in my carry on luggage despite it being cleared by ba in dubai but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through perhaps she is the model random manager ba aspires to for future leadership in any case this manager was so eager to check by carry on in that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check in agents location such is the competency and class of this manager but then again one can expect no less from ba either finally at toronto the checked in carry on came half hour after the already delayed regular checked in luggage adding salt to wound i flew to london from dubai several times last year on emirates and on klm delta air france to toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry on from any of them finally i called the uk customer relations center from toronto but i gave up about being put on hold for almost minutes they are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too i wish i could give this rotten airline but the minimum is and i am happy with that 
1846, london heathrow to copenhagen after many horrible experiences on ba i am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyers i am aa executive platinum and i am being treated worse than cattle forced to check in carry on bag which is within the ba limits on multiple occasions denied boarding zero upgrade policy zero flexibility when being forcefully re booked recently i had to pay in addition to an already expensive ticket for a hr eu flight i live in london and i m a loyal american airlines frequent flyer clocking around miles a year i will avoid british airways even if it means an extra connection flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all 
1847, london gatwick to antigua return the charge to reserve your seat is extortionate the check in staff at gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness the inflight meal was appalling and the pre arrival meal snack was a joke british airways is run by bean counters who want to charge extricate the maximum amount of money for the minimum expenditure no wonder british airways are slipping down the ratings lists 
1848, kiev to belfast via london heathrow my last two flights on british airways have been a nightmare the first flight ba informed me at the airport i no longer had a ticket as they had oversold the flight they then explained i would have a free hotel stay as if i had won a prize i avoided them for months after that one then i slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to ukraine on the return trip they asked me if i would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day as my outbound plane was delayed i said no thank you as my ba connecting flight was delayed by the same amount i arrived minutes prior to take off for the connection all in the same terminal suddenly the boarding pass on my phone disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for am the following day they ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought i would not make it here i am is my reply sorry sir the plane is now closed so you sold my ticket on no sir but the plane is closed it cant be closed there is plenty of time yes but there are no seats i debated the point i wouldn t debate the point sir a lot of people have been pushed off flights today and hotels in london are being booked out if i were you i would jump on the internet and find accommodation because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london ba cover rooms up to fine though if you have kids they give you a mere to cover breakfast lunch and dinner for each child in london good luck get a hotel arrive back at the airport the next day wait in line for hours luckily i arrived hours early for domestic flight get to the check in desk guess what i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away again of course its my problem go to the special management desk sir at that desk they tell me it could be today i get home it could be tomorrow but its hard to say given the xmas period but all in super surly tone and it was clear this was all my fault you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times absolutely disgusting attitude every other airline i have dealt with in these type of situations booked me a hotel and had a bus waiting or a taxi with a return boarding pass for the next day its a shame as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch a team that is utterly let down by corporate with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies so i would love to fly ba for the crew and pilots but given their utterly terrible customer care its just not worth it 
1849, london heathrow to cape town in economy food was good as was the service with very friendly cabin crew i think some people expect too much on aircraft airlines are cutting back flights left on time not sure what will happen when british airways start to charge for food and drinks on european flights from january not sure this will be a good move

1852, london to edinburgh return check in at t quick was able to use the fast track and galleries north lounge due to frequent flier status quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer boarding onto a new looking a seat a with an empty seat next to me departed min late but otherwise a quick hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice landed about minutes late but bags off quickly return check in again very quick but security pretty long used the ba lounge at edi which is quiet with a few food and drink options boarded throu gate seat f on a pretty old boeing which was full departed on time for a flight of hr min so landed about min late service okay again with a snack and drink offered okay experience i use ba domestically and in business clas around europe because heathrow is convenient to where i live and to sustain my executive club oneworld status however there are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that ba charge which i hate additionally i see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for food in economy on domestic european flights which puts them budget bracket i covered flights this year in all classes and while i will continue to use ba in uk europe however this year i ve realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the oneworld alliance

1854, flew from heathrow to buenos aires i haven t flown british airways for around years and with work i usually fly either middle eastern or asian airlines what a contrast i doubt ba have changed anything in that aircraft in the years since i last flew the tv screen is just in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available nothing of interest with the music either food was quite tasty but small portion no side salad drinks other than water were only offered at meal times seats are so narrow i paid extra for the emergency seat after reading how narrow the seats were a wise decision but i shouldn t be paying extra as all middle east and asian airlines i have flown have bigger seats better food choice better entertainment how can they offer such a poor service 
1855, hong kong to london first time doing long haul on british airways arm rest does not fully go up and i had an empty seat next to me food was miserable especially the dinner a giant chicken chunk with some vegetables and potatos leg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat and cramped inflight entertainment was a bore too little adult music like rock country jazz some staff were very polite and pleasant while or were grumpy and seemed to not want to be working and dragging their feet csl was fab and another male attendant working the first cabin of world traveler on the main deck when i could not sleep and went to the galley to chat lack of snack choices which was poor how many lemon cookies can you eat got to love that they do multiple rounds of drink service as singapore airlines never has this for a hour flight or more 
1856, flew london heathrow to bangkok with british airways in premium economy in an old tired plane the tray table didn t work in fact broken and the screen was dirty the colour was going white wine was warm starter was a strange red cabbage in mayonnaise dreadful main was a good piece of beef with unpleasant veg then what appeared to be a piece of cake the staff then disappeared the trays weren t then cleared for an hour when i went to the back for another drink all the staff were there having a coffee besieged by people wanting things they had lost a grip of the service in economy people were working round the uncleared food trays the breakfast was english better than dinner but no bread just awful danish pastry poor thinking of what premium economy costs 
1857, disappointed almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room definitely better meals and cost a lot less so don t choose british airways unless you are getting a good deal no choice of meals only veg or non veg and the quality and quantity was extremely poor they don t even contain any salad no snacks with the drinks delhi london was approx hrs but served only one meal was informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just dumped without even bothering to ask us if we would like to have it same on the leg from london to washington dc not that it mattered because the meals are not at all good to top it all my luggage did not arrive on return to washington dc 
1858, british airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longer my first bad experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboard i had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so i could wait having a refreshment but this th december was just not acceptable and my last trip with them i had three flights lined up san diego to seville all three operated with british airways their first plane was late by two hours by the time we arrived into london i had lost my connecting flight they said i was on my own because i booked them separately so i had to buy new tickets and pay for my own stay overnight their behaviour is one of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to get to your destination 
1859, london to philadelphia we paid for the premium economy upgrade and the flight attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complaining that was not our problem and we did not get what we paid for full comfort of the upgrade i have reached out to british airways several times to no avail in fact the one time the british airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to get my money back 
1860, dallas ft worth to mumbai via london heathrow after a reroute due to lufthansa strike overall british airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience ground staff at dfw were ok though there was no agent in the lounge till about hours before departure on board the seat if flat but very narrow food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china no flair and was unimaginative at best crew on both flights were fairly mediocre just went through the motions but didn t seem particularly interested in passenger service at all the second meal on lhr bom was the worst meal i have had on an airplane literally a deep fried potato and thats it lounge at lhr was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection sad display for their main hub overall i would not fly on ba by choice given their mediocre product the still have seat across in business compared with on af aa and ua 
1861, flew from lhr to aus british airways club world seats are barely wider than coach and the curvature of the shell makes it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach until the seat is almost half reclined profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inches could barely wedge myself into the window seat despite unrestricted aisle access couldn t get out of the seat without putting my hand on and pulling down the seat divider footstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flight plane is new with great windows restrooms a bit cramped compared to airbus flight crew was fine meal service was adequate wines were good in flight kitchen has been cut back to almost nothing my upgrade was heavily discounted and i would never pay full price for club world 
1862, london to hong kong in business class having chosen the best seat this is important i had a good flight onboard the a upper deck service is good but unexceptional professional but no pamper as is ba if on a with my chosen seat this may be my preferred flight between lhr and hkg i take numerous flights on this route in business class 
1863, manchester to heathrow connecting onto virgin atlantic to shanghai i arrived at manchester terminal at and checked in to my booked flights my outbound transfer flight ba was delayed by over hours schedule actual at manchester airport the ba service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers after a hour queue they refused to help me re book any flights to shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the heathrow ba service desk i boarded the late flight to manchester hoping that ba heathrow could help me with the connecting virgin atlantic flight when i arrived at heathrow this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to shanghai my flight landed over hours late in terminal schedule actual upon arrival at heathrow i proceeded to go to the ba service desk at terminal to find the next flights to shanghai after a hour wait in the queue the ba service personnel were not only unhelpful but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me they refused to help me book another flight to shanghai they refused to book me on a flight back to manchester they refused to help me retrieve my luggage they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the air fare i explained that i was now stranded in heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further when i pleaded with the ba staff to move my return ba flight back to manchester forwards to allow me to get home the ba personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that i was no longer blocking other customers at no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that i was in i was left outside terminal with no transport no accommodation and no luggage eventually after asking several helpful members of airport staff i retrieved my luggage from terminal i organised myself a hotel in heathrow at after an exhausting hours and now need to figure out how to get home 
1864, iad lhr return in world traveller plus quite enjoyable flights both ways with first rate leg room in in wtp vs in in regular wt remains a strong positive point with me some of the best airline cuisine i ve had in recent years an excellent pre meal drinks service including tribute cornish ale on time departure arrival and the attentive courteous cabin crew service i ve received through the years from british airways two tiny flyspecks though no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip this remains my favourite way of flying between the usa and europe i am a regular skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews ba s regular tourist class service has latterly received in this forum haven t flown it myself in a couple of years though but on this and other recent showings ba s world traveller plus premium economy remains as good as ever 
1865, flew club world from chengdu to london last week my first time on ba long haul for a few years how they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery with the onboard product being simply awful and this on a newer boeing plane the cabin was tatty tables loose problems with seat recline mechanism ife clunky and slow the food was not even to economy standards and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving amenity kit second rate the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish and whilst the flight was quite empty in business the service seemed to be on a go slow staff when they appeared in the cabin were quite friendly but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that ba now provide i will go back to using my preferred asian airlines and i can only assume other ba loyals will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving ba down to low cost airline levels

1867, london heathrow to seattle on a redemption ticket in premium economy boarding and departure both efficient a few empty seats in the separate cabin so that contributed to a relaxed flight service was casual to the point of we don t really care food acceptable just ife adequate seat became uncomfortable in the last or hours of the flight 
1868, manchester to heathrow similar to the flight up with efficient boarding and impressive that a trolley service is squeezed in unfortunately delayed again for the same time as the duration of the flight due to gate unavailability otherwise this is a great little short hop 
1869, heathrow to manchester short hop of just mins in the air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due to someone not boarding done this flight a number of times and kudos to the fact they manage to get a trolley service in before landing alcoholic drink is free which is something considering this isn t the case even on hr trans american flights 
1870, i have been a loyal ba frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change on my recent long haul flight to nairobi from london i was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free like some cut rate budget short haul airline you have to pay however unlike a budget airline ba fares remain higher than most i returned from nairobi in premium economy yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare i paid to be in premium breakfast consisted of muffin literally muffin only no juice no fruit no nothing it is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have as i have always done accepted the higher fares for better service even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime it is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free note that ba never cut fares when the price of oil halved making the current cutbacks about pure avarice disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula and i wouldn t blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated the final insult was the response i got when i tweeted my above complaints i was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting muffin instead of the usual breakfast while paying the same fare which as is apparent to all a complete lie and insult to injury i am flying again next week lon nyc and hope not optimistically for better 
1871, seattle to london heathrow the british airways lounge at seattle is very poor for starters with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression it s still the s plane was half full as it was thanksgiving day so that made for a nice relaxed flight no real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal no juice fruit etc and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide and when they did was just handed to me without anything else glad this ticket was on miles value for money rating below is given on basis that it was a revenue ticket

1875, british airways crew going out from london heathrow to calgary were very keen and enthusiastic they were also very good fun which makes life more pleasant up in the sky we do this flight every months on our way to visit family in canada food was good but like other reviewers we ve noticed little changes which make things not quite so special for instance the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be and there used to be a choice of types of red or white one of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food so take some snacks with you for the wee small hours on the return journey the dinner was good but they ran out of beef in premium economy and there were only of us we were given food from business but it was served on a freezing cold plate and just lacked finesse i know this is only premium economy but there were good standards a few years back the breakfast before landing at heathrow was horrible a bagel with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars i must write and complain to ba about their breakfasts and have done so once with no effect i will try again the staff were very efficient and we felt safe and there were regular drinks runs but like many others who travel regularly with ba we were a little disappointed and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years

1878, british airways from london to bangkok return if you are thinking about flying british airways to bangkok don t do it thai airways or eva air for the same price offer a much better service for direct flights if you want the best go with emirates but it s a stop over flight i fly this route times a year here are the key reasons why you should not fly with british airways from my experience i believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying the aircraft are very old if you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you can you wait service is in mins this has been tested a few times they hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers the next service could be in hour but they will still tell you mins entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm no phone charger and no usb port no wifi seats are very old very uncomfortable

1880, singapore to sydney in business class the price was lowish so we booked never again seat comfort was almost non existent with appalling ergonomics the in flight service hit a new low for me absolutely shambolic no team effort aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers food and drink were cut price and worsened by late wine and bread no water offered and meal items forgotten entertainment choices were sub par no noise cancelling headphones no cosmetics in the dirty toilets a dollar shop amenity bag i have had better economy experiences than this sector shame on you british airways 
1881, hong kong to london seats k and j it was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail my other half who is was locked into a paralysed position for hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for of the flight the small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort he couldn t even watch the in flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined as a shorter limbed person at i was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight placed in the middle i barely had any where to put myself seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build my headphone socket was crackling and the film i wanted to watch cleopatra with the desperate hope of killing hours of time wasn t working it was just a black screen with audio after travelling long haul last year to tokyo with another european airline i could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on ba within minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers on ba we had to wait at least minutes before being offered a drink on this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with ba long haul ever again

1886, bassinets by british airways cater for newborn only my month old son could not fit in it the only option was a child seat however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat the only option is to sleep on you however the arm rests are fixed in and hard couple that with the need to breast feed your child with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat either his head would get banged on the armrest or he d kick the armrest at the other end it was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from london to hong kong other airlines offer bassinets up to one years some even years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours imagine a hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he can t fit in the seat and every so often you fear he ll fall off your lap to travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and british airways refuse to do anything about it

1888, new york jfk to london pleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on ba although the aircraft was relatively old the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch i had a rude shock when i was told i had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright the slack with ba is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat it is their way of ancillary income the ife can be improved as they have very limited offerings cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive they were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departure they showed compassion and were professional in their services 
1889, london heathrow to belfast city a really good flight left on time crew smiled and looked like they were having fun a full cooked british breakfast which was served with great efficiency and was hot interactions with passengers positive landed on time and as had no luggage we were in the long queue for rental car in no time at all flight back was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day check in was surly but on board crew still fine on both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and i liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passenger fare was cheap too the only disappointment being that they don t have business class on domestic flights so we couldn t treat ourselves to a bit of luxury
1890, london to toronto return business class outbound first return no complaints at all both flights departed on time and landed slightly early food actually quite decent for once and crew on top of their game both directions had the latest entertainment system both ways clean comfy seats not much else to add if only british airways could get it this right every time 
1891, chennai to london heathrow with british airways ok service and flight but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft i understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the on a long daytime flight you can t cut out the sunshine just lower its intensity seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over you not up to standard the lounge in chennai was also poor 
1892, singapore to london having not flown british airways long haul for over fifteen years i was pleasantly surprised on my recent return trip to london the premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above average however more important was the unobtrusive service provided by the cabin staff whereby announcements are kept to a minimum and there is no constant patrolling during the flight both flights left and arrived on time overall a very good experience

1894, marrakesh to london gatwick with british airways i fly ba very frequently and the service varies each time the lounge at marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks miniature bottles of wine between approx passengers however the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne the cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a hour flight this was brilliant the flightdeck kept us updated during the flight my only other issue would be my baggage was marked with priority but was one of the last to come off 
1895, it was a horrible experience while coming back from sydney to singapore on british airways our baby stroller was marked for some other airline en route to france so we now have to wait long way if it will finally come back to singapore we ordered special hindu meal as per their staff hindu meal is a vegeterian however we were served rice and lamb after that there was no alternate arrangements made even the refreshment meal was provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eat the cabin temperature was very low and worsened during our hrs journey i pledge not to take british airways ever

1897, london heathrow to san francisco with british airways ba was once a classy airline for their first class service amenities and food but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points they even hijack you for an additional or as i like to say you cough up k in points and the fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu second the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu first class was maybe full when it was my turn i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food minutes after leaving the airport clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies at the average price of for a first class seat ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated way to go ba you have sunk to the lowest common denominator third when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first ba is always hit and mostly miss finally what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience yes i say and not once has someone called i am waiting for the day when ba announces all passengers including first should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale

1899, first leg dus to lhr was club europe while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight crumbs on the seat table was sticky asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape in general the looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details e g carpet should be replaced extremely dirty and roved lounge in lhr very outdated boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don t listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons crew on board once again very friendly and effective meal choice was ok but my impression is that quality is going down e g beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked club kitchen long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays selection seems to go down every time i fly worst of all one of my bags did not made it to the aircraft this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke after identifying that my bag seems to be lost i went to the counter even if finding it is not that easy in boston i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another bag although i had my tag that i could show to her i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help no apologies for inconvience at all last year i had one bag that was delayed this handling was done by another person and was completely different experience extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience summarizing flying ba for business for many years and on a regular basis now the changes under the new boss can be seen while in the past british airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month this time flight was one of the worst i ever had with ba i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future e g a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only one thinking like this i can t any longer recommend ba as especially the value for money is no longer given 
1900, london to singapore in first class was british airways at its best the concorde lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisite i was welcomed to the first class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew there was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly helpful and interested as well as anticipating what i needed the food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up after dinner the crew member assigned to me a mirthful frenchman made my bed and i had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full english the aircraft arrived on time and we left with a minimum of fuss the cabin was clean the seats seemed new and the toilets although small were kept spotless i could not fault anything before and during this flight 
1901, london heathrow to delhi return i thought air india was the worst until i traveled by british airways via premium economy prices are not at all comparable thus i assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not all british airways staff at delhi airport were rude and unprofessional i have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag i was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it coming to the aircraft food and staff equally poor food was horrific seats were torn headphone socket not working food tray was broken i was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches staff was not able to help at all nightmare experience 
1902, marrakech to london gatwick with british airways baggage allowance is a joke doesn t matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane however on boarding the plane there were people that had or even items of luggage which were far larger than ours these items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken when we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on when contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline we will certainly never be using ba again 
1903, domestic economy from london heathrow to belfast return check in at t quick and easy i was able to use fast track and the north executive lounge through my ff status boarding through gate a onto a clean looking a departed on time crew provided a snack and drink on the hour flight return check in again quick although the security system at bhd is slow very slow used the executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks it s also adjacent to the gate used by ba is pretty handy departed on time seat b on another clean a crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight flight time on the return a little longer hr min due to congestion at lhr good service i guess the only option not cheap but would use again even if i had a choice

1908, london gatwick to antigua having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of to british airways world traveller plus and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meals and beverages what we received was a polarisation of this we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasions in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received it was more like a budget airline we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this was quickly followed with a drink service one drink per passenger we then received our meal service i asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice about minutes later they served lukewarm coffee this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin after several hours when no other drinks service was offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fianc to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine which neither one of us drink as the flight wasn t full i cant believe there would be a problem you just don t expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have drinks on an hour plus flight hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours certainly not what i would expect from an airline such as ba our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasn t full we ended up with seats between of us the service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant i was looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat which i certainly don t think that justifies upgrade fee if you are thinking of upgrading i would think twice about what you are paying for ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not alone in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route if that is the case they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid 
1909, london heathrow to moscow with british airways good terminal ground service reasonable former bmi a with avod entertainment which was nice seat comfort okay for hours but would not have liked any longer staff service completely forgettable from the outset they really weren t making the effort minimal communication and rushed services at the start and end of the flight food is a joke a very small sandwich for a hour flight it honestly can t get any lower or can it flight kept to schedule ticket was quite good value and my rating is really based on the value rather than experience 
1910, london gatwick to barbados with british airways ba now stands for budget airways having flown ba for many years in all classes from first to economy i could not believe how everything has declined so drastically i was offered a drink no snacks were offered as in the past there was a choice of meals a pasta and sausages and mash by the time it got to me there was only one meal on offer i was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal before arrival in barbados afternoon tea was a mini twix bar i took and was ordered to put one back the earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears the return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun having recently flown on oman air virgin atlantic and turkish airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic mr cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not vueling ba as our national airline is a total embarrassment

1916, i booked flights with british airways from london kuala lumpur bandar kuala lumpur london these were all booked at the same time and they also took the booking therefore contract with royal brunei airlines rbi for the kl bandar kl legs for whatever reason rbi cancelled one of the flights and it was only by accident that i found this out by going on the ba website i had to change a flight and waste a day in brunei ba have refused all responsibility even on the lack of communicating the cancelled flight to me i find this deplorable after booking everything through ba i would certainly never book anything direct with ba again as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable 
1917, the space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrous i have flown budget airlines that offer better leg room this carrier is aware that they have exclusivity on business class on this route as there are no alternatives for the price paid for these tickets versus the value received this is daylight robbery next time i need to travel to ct i will fly saa through jhb

1919, barcelona to london has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to spain according to a british airways gate agent at barcelona airport i supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave spain i drove across the border from the states to meet a friend in canada and flew out from vancouver on the same day to london for a week and then from london to spain for two weeks all along the way of going through customs of canada uk and spain i was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when i was leaving spain all of a sudden this gate agent asked me where are you going where do you live are you traveling alone i thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me you have to wait here i need to talk to someone there were at least over people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why i cannot get on the airplane i am a permanent resident of us however i am a citizen of the country participates in visa waver program which means i don t need visa to enter spain and definitely not when i leave so what s wrong my name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my us permanent resident card does not match with my passport of course i just got married so that i have different last name from my passport but even that what kind of right does she have to ask me for my us permanent resident card and stop me at the gate like that so when she asked me if i have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name i jokingly answered marriage certificate next thing i know was i cannot get on the airplane because i didn t have marriage certificate with me and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone she said to me you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you it was beyond ridiculous

1922, london to lisbon with british airways very bad flight when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up my luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that i had in the plane and people that i must say had bigger luggage then my own once in the plane fast exit from heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips or peanuts very healthy on the arrival at lisbon plane parked near the military aerodrome on portela figo maduro and minutes bus ride to the terminal and more minutes to wait for luggage long time ba customer but do not know if i will fly again 
1923, recently flew a return trip with ba to miami onboard one of their a aircraft and what has happened to this airline outbound flight delayed hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround having flown the route several times on the we were looking forward to trying the a we were seated in row which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area from the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn t hear it this went on for hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was normal on all their a aircraft the food was horrid and only a choice of meals i chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy the return flight was a different a which had the same awful noise but it did stop around hours prior to arrival the food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the breakfast it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle the standards have dropped so far it is incredible i m certain if i sat in row on emirates or the like i wouldn t be issued with ear plugs i m booked to miami once more in early fortunately on a quiet and after that i will no longer fly with ba 
1924, lisbon to london with british airways nice flight fast boarding full flight but left lisbon on time and got to london with no delays food on flight was nice for such a cheap flight not like my return trip but british airways makes us feel special when the service is ok 
1925, the flight started in the first class concorde lounge at t it is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats the seat cushions need refilling the general ambiance is quite good a refurbishment is long overdue the food quality and choice is generally quite poor although the crab tortellini was good nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks i had to walk the floor and find someone all sloppy the menus also were worn and scruffy and someone a child i think had scribbled on the inside some funny cartoons we boarded and the flight departed to the minute all good the boeing has a small st class and i realized that the space also is smaller than the option the alternative is a total disaster and i go to great lengths to avoiding flying their s food was ok very little wow factor the meze was fine they ran out of cod and at this point i don t think we had hit the cruise seven from eight passenger and only one cod apparently i had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights i prefer not to have meat my wife s allocated seat was broken hence the vacant seat on the flight so she sat one side of the plane and i sat the other brilliant the plane was only six months old given the competition on this route you would think ba would want to impress was it a coincidence i wonder that there was no arabic or asian passengers on the flight with emirates on this route why would there be we landed on time and then had to walk miles another underwhelming experience with ba i wonder what those who spent one way thought 
1926, the flight started badly in the so called new concorde lounge at dubai i have reviewed this in the lounge section the situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure apparently minimum rest period had been compromised not sure if this was true but we ended up with a crew not a crew on the the first seating is double that of a and result was we were served the entire full cabin of by one fa he did his best but must have walked about miles in the flight trying to keep us happy the boeing first seat is the largest of the three options mine was starting to show signs of wear no amuse bouche as announced last month ba have cut back this cost wow a saving on a o one way ticket well done ba champagne was lukewarm as is often the case lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly horrible in fact the soup was the usual butternut squash soup do they offer anything else or am i unlucky and was lukewarm but okay the apricot chicken was pleasant enough but i could not taste any apricot a bistro product at best later in the flight i had afternoon tea sandwiches all dry and tasteless watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice landed without being stacked for a change as one comes to expect with ba underwhelming due to the bean counters at lhr cutting back as well as increasing fares i d like to see the entire ba board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier

1928, london heathrow to bangkok with british airways and they operate some of their oldest planes on this route so the screen is only with square lines across the screen the food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route only two offerings of water on the outbound flight usually fly this route in business class and british airways offering is far inferior product on this route also despite being silver member will be voting with my feet and using other airlines when available on all future travels this was one bad trip too many with british airways

1930, this was my first time to fly into london city airport with british airways i found the experience to be very positive indeed the check in agent was very friendly and professional and made a very positive first impression the gate staff were friendly and polite and boarding was quick and efficient during this short flight the captain was informative and the cabin crew did a sterling job at serving drinks and snacks on a relatively short flight disembarkation was orderly and my bag arrived in good time too i am a very happy customer and will use this route again in the future 
1931, scheduled to fly out of johannesburg on ba on th october but due to aircraft delays a managed to get onto another flight boeing to ensure i caught my connection to charlotte from london this particular boeing had clearly had its day but was infinitely better than my return flight on the a i paid an additional fee for my seat but irrespective felt packed in the seat was very uncomfortable slow service from section cabin staff and in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft chaotic boarding did not help matters will in future use one of the us airlines for this route 
1932, london to los angeles initially late boarding as aircraft was late on stand so cleaning could ve been better negatives over and everything else was superb the overall ambience isn t flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be british to fully understand i suppose the champagne fine wines and cognac complimented the restaurant quality a la carte meal and the service was second to none from our geordie steward we loved the fact that one of our cabins could be set as a table for 
1933, london gatwick to mauritius return our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable but new to british airways we were prepared to wait and see the inbound flight commented upon here was much worse but with many facets of the earlier experience we paid two supplements for the flights a substantial fee to upgrade from economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients on overnight flights we could sit together the combined cost therefore was significant the benefits were not firstly upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood a lady ahead of us had a headrest problem she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated throughout the flight during waking hours passengers seemed to be a nuisance food as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines we were expecting a menu to select meals how silly here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice chicken or veg a bright green risotto so no choice no bread roll no cheese and bikkies a choice of one red wine and plastic cutlery this was served after the attention in economy and may account for the absence of choice whatever it was awful it was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten what a waste of resources significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration the premium economy wtplus cabin had no provision for toilets it was necessary to go forward to club or back to economy it became clear early on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin so back it was during the night with passenger debris in aisles this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags from headphone containers to slip on is nobody in british airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for passengers is essential on arrival in uk we read that ba is to put even more seats in economy class on this type of aircraft goodbye british airways not even nice to have used you 
1934, athens to london heathrow in economy class the food for a hour flight is only a sandwich for lunch drink service instead of in the old days so you better order everything you need for the whole flight british airways service keeps on getting worse and worse it s a shame because the crew are actually generally friendly and nice people i will only fly getting worse and worse if they are cheaper than all the competition which they almost never are 
1935, london heathrow to kuala lumpur concorde lounge at lhr nice check in easy at first area was excited to try the boeing and new first on this special occasion trip cabin intimate with semi private suites look good with nice finishing touches of leather and chrome but seats quite narrow champagne before take off nice crew but slightly inexperienced and not totally familiar with aircraft type main meal was very average scallops overcooked and main beef part overcooked on one side breakfast ok bed for sleeping comfortable but too narrow power outlets wouldn t work with my iphone or ipad table for dinner wouldn t extend properly and reading light fell out of its socket on a new aircraft we had a lovely flight all in redeeming avios for occasion the new first is an improvement but ba need to revaluate their offering against competion likes of qatar airways emirates singapore etc because their products and onboard service lags behind

1937, larnaca to london heathrow and wow british airways has gone downhill very grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal if you can call it that was a sandwich and a small coffee in a paper cup this is on a five hour flight british airways needs to take a look at the likes of qatar airways etc 
1938, first time using british airways as always flown virgin but routes from orlando to gatwick were full with virgin the flight was cancelled with no reason for hours no apologies a text message sent to my phone hours before departure with no telephone or contact number after an hour of ringing everybody i could at ba i ended up being passed to an offshore call centre if you deal with ba this will be where you call for everything cut off three times and completely incoherent i was traveling with my wife and year old daughter in club world seating the plane was over years old and whilst serviceable it was in a dire state my daughter commented this is like a dustbin with wings daddy when we got into the cabin on arrival to my club world bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere i handed it to a stewardess who said that bit isn t important whilst looking down at me and taking it away the inflight system was a joke the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything all the pixels were broken the charging for laptops etc was us only and the remote for the entertainment system didn t work an announcement came on before we left we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy please do not eat any nuts at anytime once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut i am proud to be british but i am incredibly embarrassed for british airways to represent my country in such a poor way fly with anybody other than ba trust me they are nothing short of a joke

1951, i hadn t flown british airways in a while but i thought i d give them a go again i was in club world seat k upper deck from london heathrow to chicago let me begin by saying that ba crews are tremendous they are friendly approachable professional amiable and affable the flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements the service on board was very good the food was plentiful and quite tasty the inflight entertainment was excellent loads of choices and great quality all in all a great experience based on that i will keep flying ba for my transatlantic flights again the crews are a credit to ba they do a great a job 
1952, vancouver to london heathrow i was booked on air canada but rebooked onto british airways as i was unable to make the ac flight since ac cancelled an earlier flight from yyj to yvr having flown british airways in the past i was looking forward to flying them again but my trip was somewhat disappointing seat on the boeing not the most comfortable but still a slightly bit better than on air canada s across boeing er meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice it was fairly tasteful cabin crew seemed approachable but after the meal service cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the hr flight to london i wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button then waited over minutes until a cabin crew walked by before landing breakfast was served consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar it is very evident that ba s service standard has slipped considerably since i last flew with them in how the mighty have fallen

1954, i was pleasantly surprised by the experience first time for premium economy with this particular airline the seat was comfortable with ample legroom the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient the flight was quiet and smooth on time and made up time on the flight the only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight we did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about people into business the rest of us went without for hours it worked fine on the return journey and i guess it s just one of those things just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored

1956, british airways was the cheapest airline when i booked this flight from edinburgh to gatwick cheaper than easyjet great service ok snack food professional all round captain spoke with me personally plane was on time and no issues best value flight from a great little airport 
1957, silver card holder with british airways and pps card with singapore singapore to london leg average when called for service staff had a bit of an attitude like it wasn t their job so doesn t do ba any favours hours late and they sent the baggage to the wrong part of the airport so mins delay at the baggage area barcelona flight average worst bit ba codeshare booked ba find out it s vueling ba have not got their act together on codeshare at all as silver card holder booking ba i had zero ba rights tried to charge me for second bag free for silver card holder get to the lounge ba have explicitly asked for vueling codeshare to be excluded so no ability to use lounge had to pay to select my seat ba trying to save money because the vueling flight was third leg none of the check in online to singapore on ba leg worked so i had to go to the ba desk to get checked in before dropping my bags message to ba i have close to a million miles on ba i chose ba for this trip i could have chose sq star alliance your lst couple of years focus on cost control and being cheap and not sorting out a codeshare process for both standards and your poor it interaction that doesn t treat me as a cardholder and works just put me in the will fly sq next time i come to europe bracket you can cost cut yourself out of business 
1958, i am tall cm to be exact that s why on a recent flight from london to brussels i couldn t face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat instead i decided to pay to fly in british airways business class what a mistake on arrival to heathrow s terminal i tried to enter the queue at zone b as directed by one of the information signs i was told that the staff had decided to close that so i had to go somewhere else i joined the queue at c instead but was told when i got to the front that business class checked in at h i made my way to british airways business class lounge which was crowded dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run down bus station than an airline s lounge the place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room it was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where i waited for my flight the gate was announced and i made my way to gate c where the flight was being bussed i was in seat d it was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom the whole point of spending was legroom and i didn t have any i asked the flight attendant if anything could be done ba would not have been my choice anyway but i do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment in that case don t make the same mistake as me british airways 
1959, athens to heathrow i cannot believe that british airways want to embarrass flight staff so much as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served which we were never warned about we paid over for our flight two of us it is so sad for loyal customers if we wanted to go on easyjet or ryanair we would but to receive the same treatment is a great shame 
1960, extremely chaotic check in at mla with no british airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non c class ff members security even more busy with ryanair and easyjet passengers going through priority fast track flight ok with warm food chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes also with mushroom and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy saying that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to pre order your meal online or over the phone for that specific allergy ba should do something about this annoying passengers as per usual when using lgw for me that s a holiday airport with people who don t fly often yet they claim to be the alfa and omega of flying to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and i quote obviously you don t fly much us being silver with ba and gold with lh landed ahead of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until all were offloaded despite having a priority tag on them excellent and friendly cabin crew 
1961, flew from bangkok to london heathrow once again the cabin b crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so i never got a welcome drink the seat was the standard club world seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right anything in between feel awkward the food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition as always ba s lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing the club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems however the meal service is reasonably quick at just over hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight the inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall pre landing snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings if i had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price i would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided british airways needs to step up their game to get my money again 
1962, london gatwick pisa return another less than satisfactory experience with british airways i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany when i first flew this route as opposed to ryanair on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience now as a cost cutting exercise you don t which means if its raining you get wet which we did the ba lgw club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the north terminal it was fine very busy but the light lunch was better than ba s own set up the last time we used it plane left minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot i settled for a couple of g ts and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine on the return the club europe lines at pisa check in were used by just about anyone it was a zoo the ba airport crew didn t care and given the management at ba don t care about customer service and quality why should they lunch was quite pleasant some sort of chicken dish we got stacked for minutes which is annoying on both flights i got the front row which gave more legroom the seats well the usual abysmal so called club europe a disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale fas in both directions were splendid they get very embarrassed about talking about ba cutbacks who wouldn t flying st class next week to the middle east not holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience 
1963, had pre booked seat k and on taking seat noticed rubbish piled at back of seat empty plastic bottles and paper etc overall the cabin appeared dated and untidy also the in flight entertainment screen did not work on arrival in uk complained to british airways but got a somewhat stock reply apologising and received a derisory e voucher as compensation when flew back to thailand flight no ba sep at check in member of staff advised he was unable to print of boarding pass for onward flight bangkok to chiangmai but assured me this was quite normal and would cause no problems with luggage booked through to final destination i was advised by bangkok airport that without the second boarding pass i would have to go landside to check in at bangkok airways domestic check in a complete fiasco ensued highlighting the ineptitude of british airways staff ba motto to fly to serve i think not

1965, tokyo haneda to london and british airways is cost cutting all the time i was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering for a hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food the tuck box vanished from your offering we got served a small breakfast at departure am tokyo time and nothing until minutes before landing pretty much hours with no food so not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed it looks like despite ba s good profits they are cost cutting to extreme levels perhaps the ceo could try out this sector in world traveller or world traveller plus rather the the first class he probably uses on a long haul flight and see how he feels at the end of it maybe he will turn a little skinnier certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience 
1966, i had a perfectly satisfactory flight with british airways to boston and back this month oct i slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol the only reason i fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and i dislike the club seating arrangement apart from breakfast scrambled eggs i hardly eat on long haul generally speaking the cabin crews are good and attentive and it s a bonus if you get some ex concorde crew i never want to board the aircraft early as i know that i will not have trouble stowing my bags in first a previous review complained that on the there is only one toilet in first but there are only seats all in all i use ba because from the uk i can get to any part of the world quickly with few changes and in safety 
1967, san francisco to manchester via heathrow marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey a year old a the seats were much nicer than the outbound flight seat a i did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor can t say if that s a good thing for ba or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first a flight that s the positives out of the way no sense of organisation to the boarding process just folk stood by a gate cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding pm departure so i was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as i could at pm meal arrived no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals i got a bread roll she didn t she got a dessert i didn t neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty i had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a diet coke woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it a folded omelette potato wedges and a cherry tomato breakfast of kings the final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long i had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives the minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing my quick connecting flight to manchester was pretty much the same too if i could rate things as stars i would i m ashamed british airways is my national carrier 
1968, manchester to san francisco via heathrow first time flying with british airways and will most certainly be my last hour flight from london heathrow to san francisco on a very very tired looking boeing was not what i had expected ife system was sparse in choice and colour pixels on the screen couldn t sit with my partner as unlike most leading carriers ba opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens when check in did open we were assigned seats miles apart and the plane was fully booked so hours of no real ife and the option to talk to my partner involved a minute walk across the plane we could have opted to go with virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with ba who as far as i can work out are on ryanair s level of additional charges never again british airways never again 
1969, after many years of flying on ba being a gold member for the last years i have finally lost my patience with ba there is no point ba even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong i recently spent over on a flight to singapore outbound being first and inbound in club world the plane was a fairly new a and on the outbound journey the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly the crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn t a very pleasant experience from the passengers and the crew might i add on the inbound a few days later we were delayed by hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane must have been the same aircraft as the outbound the ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn t feel it was fair departing on a hour voyage with no running water in the toilets it meant no running water to flush the toilet although the suction system still worked and not running taps to clean ourselves and of course no tea of coffee facilities hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey they had to get the plane to land back at lhr just before the hour delay to stop each passengers claiming eur under the eu compensation policy the plane landed back to lhr hr min late to top things off after landing back to lhr the ground crew from ba forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further hr min so in summary i get home hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in the answer from ba customer relations was avios points what s going to get me surely i ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me couldn t do anymore as the supervisor s decision is final can i speak to the supervisor i ask i am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on ba he she might have the decency to speak to me the answer was no they don t speak to anyone 
1970, bari to gatwick yet another abysmal flight from ba no wonder the majority of passangers flying short haul these days are on package tours anyone making individual booking obviously travels with other more customer focused airlines check in at bari was resonable smooth unlike on my outward flight but the boarding process was the now expected chaos the decision to issue hand luggage only tickets is a poor one unlike other airlines no attempt appears to be made to regulate the size or weight of bags carried on board on this flight i witnessed several arguments over locker space the cabin crew greeted us with bored zombie like expressions meal service costed of a barely edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesse the drinks arrived a good half an hour later than the food it seems the the one aim of ba cabin crew is to provide minimum service as fast as possible to maximise the time available to gossip in the galley do ba executives never sample their economy short haul product

1977, london heathrow to kuala lumpur very poor service this is their much vaunted boeing first class could not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book weeks in advance the cabana in their lounge was smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet shower nobody bothered to check if i needed anything priority boarding was a joke outbound service on board was mediocre cabin crew slow to anticipate passengers needs no wifi one toilet and the same size as in a low cost airline food ok but not great on arrival i asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with we don t do fast track here return flight was equally poor rang the bell and no one came rang again after an hour to order breakfast stewardess came and said of course but we start serving from the other side so much for first class dining on demand the only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in kuala lumpur thanks to malaysia airlines as it is their lounge and not british airways ba lags behind air france la premi re as far as first class service is concerned

1982, london heathrow to budapest with british airways yet another abysmal flight with ba the majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups perhaps that s why service standards and comfort resemble a s charter flight the cheaper no checked baggage tickets allowing a ridiculous kg of hand luggage cause chaos on boarding with or even people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place all semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned there is no welcome on board only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage the seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable cabin so called service was nonexistant the packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea the cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through meal service to maximise time available to chat in the galley the one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time and arrived minutes early i was only on the flight as part of a tour group booking independently i would have opted for a rival low cost carrier 
1983, washington dulles to nairobi via london was excited to fly first class on ba from dulles to nairobi since it s about hours of flying time i decided to splurge on a st class ticket things started off poorly at checkin when ba s computer system went down a seemingly constant problem after minutes of waiting they were finally able to get a back up system going and i was checked in and off to their lounge great meal and service there my flying companion didn t want to splurge on a st class ticket so she was in business class it wasn t long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she s seen ba has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you re asleep well i sprung for an upgrade for her and all was well until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart here s where ba s systems again breaks down and their computer isn t working to locate the bag in the hull hours later they locate the bag and we take off we land hours late at heathrow and miss our connection to nairobi no one to assist you head off to another terminal to customer service wait minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a kenyan air flight business class in hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on ba we chose kenya airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag on our return flight i had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since i couldn t use my st class ticket no can t do that and you ll have to apply for a refund meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis i was told later that that is promotional and to hell with a paying passenger the bottom line is don t fly ba if you are going on to a distant location they are unreliable and assistance is negligible if you re just flying on to the continent where there are multiple flights you may make it 
1984, flew malaga to gatwick although a better flight than two weeks ago the service of a small packet of crisps peanuts or biscuit is a disgrace at least with other airlines you can purchase food passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering for our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of to fly to serve we will choose any other airline over british airways in future human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the ba management although the cabin staff did their very best no doubt ba management can t wait to get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge truly shocking values and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever

1988, london heathrow to geneva return appalling airline the booking process is dreadful they charge if you want to change seat in economy i have been told they will be charging for food and drink from january and the website very difficult to use their customer service via phone or email is abysmal they are extremely rude give completely wrong information and i have been cut off given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely many are extremely unhelpful this week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker the bag was not oversized but i have a bad back at present and i asked him very politely yet he outright refused though he helped other people i flew club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and i had to actively ask him to clean it which he did but with very bad grace i avoid british airways if i can but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs and every single time i do fly with them i am reminded why i dislike them so much

1990, come on british airways really i have flown ba long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks first from lim lhr and now lhr den i know that ba has refurbished some of their b and b but the rest are a disgrace as a flag carrier what message does this send to the rest of the world on a positive note the cabin crew are always polite sometimes to the point of being passive aggressive but this is a humourless service even london underground has moved from the dated uniforms the in flight catering is lack lustre i choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful you now even have to pay for the snacks between meals unlike klm or latam i understand the economics are difficult given that some nations subsidise flag carriers but small and low cost changes would make a major difference firstly smarten up the staff have you seen the lan uniforms on the last flight one crew member hadn t shaved and it wasn t designer stubble get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable the ifs systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old bbc sitcoms soaps offered on a positive note i believe ba is a safe airline and the crew professional big bonus point for me when there is a problem ba is efficient in sorting it out communication from the cockpit is usually good

1993, flew british airways from boston to london heathrow the plane was clearly dated judging by the old ife screens and even some rust here and there but the plane was clean the crew were extremely nice and polite the food was good although i would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial overall it was a nice flight a note on the ground service the way it is set up with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out leads to some people not hearing being called i could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying i have called them and they are not listening so i am not doing it anymore i really think it is not nice given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal 
1994, flew london heathrow to lisbon with british airways the plane was slightly delayed but the captain explained why and we recovered the delay on the way i believe communication to be important and appreciate the gesture the crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given was just fine for such a short flight i am only sorry we had to take a bus in lisbon to get to the terminal

1996, flew british airways to from heathrow recently as first experience have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service i absolutely agree and what a shame but ba if you actually read some of these reviews you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly when boarding rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down actually have your cabin staff positioned even in economy to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer s perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance on long transatlantic flights cabin stewards disappear for at least hours mid flight perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything or are they fearful of the extra work 
1997, we frequently use british airways morning flight from boston to london and will again but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling the english breakfast choice was a pleasant surprise until this last flight on which the reduction of portion size and quality was noticeable the pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich but on this flight it was a cookie maybe two i forget the cabin crew was efficient and friendly and the avod was excellent much improved from the older s which we have had on the route beware however fast track security at heathrow which twice in the last six months has been glacial no better than regular lines 
1998, new york jfk to d sseldorf via london heathrow the online check in was fast and easy the choice of seats free of charge was very poor even the plane was half full the check in baggage organization in jfk was a mess long lines with no priority for members you should arrive min hours before the boarding otherwise you will miss your flight the staff in the plane more less accabtable my hand luggage got misplaced in the plane i think somebody just remove it i asked the staff and at least they found my hand luggage recommendation to ba staff behaved partly unacceptable beverages and seat comfort in total okay

2001, london gatwick to mauritius i never in my life had a flight as bad as this one my husband and i were flying to mauritius for our second anniversary from gatwick airport the staff were rude and inattentive i pressed the flight attendant button so many times and after waiting mins they just switched it off however that was not the worst of it the flight was so cold we asked if they could please turn it up they didn t care multiple passengers asked for extra blankets not that it would help i was literally shaking the whole flight through even though i had multiple layers of clothes on i will never fly direct to mauritius with british airways i paid more for a direct ticket than a indirect flight but thanks ba for letting me realise paying more doesn t equate to better service 
2002, paris to bangkok via london what a mistake to choose ba for this business class flight the experience of the seats with their weird coffin like configuration sliding screens and people climbing over me almost continually was enough to say never again the service was very patchy with some decidedly long faced and size challenged cabin staff coffee undrinkable and forget having a choice main course near to inedible but the portions were thankfully miniature the wine selection was good but my unsmiling stewardess told me there was no bordeaux only merdock i should have explained that medoc is a bordeaux region but really this simply comes nowhere close to thai emirates or cathay singapore airlines is in a league way way ahead i should add that the lounges in paris and london were great paris was a share with cathay and london s terminal lounge was excellent shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating tight face to face with a complete stranger noisy and hard

2004, here i am again after my previous review weeks ago of specifically the british airways online check in system i am currently in cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to london this evening with my elderly mother we sat next to each other last night at and opened our ba apps on our phones at the same time my mother had a choice of seats on a seat boeing and i had a choice of just seats again so clear evidence of passenger inequality at ba even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class this happened weeks ago when flying from london heathrow to larnaca firstly why do i who flies several times a year with ba only get very poor location seats to choose from and another ba economy passenger gets a choice of seats to choose from secondly why do ba offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose when i fly with aeroflot you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets as it should be with every airline but ba appear to suffer from some kind of seat hoarding issue for some reason i presume they would rather people pay the to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets something i personally will never ever do 
2005, singapore to london heathrow with british airways the was our first experience on ba s a and it was very comfortable and relaxing we usually fly etihad from australia to lhr but this time decided to try ba the boarding at singapore was efficient friendly and on time as this was a late evening flight we just wanted to get settled and into bed as soon as possible we made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds the config of first class in ba is with aisles this is not as good as the etihad first which has a central aisle with individual cabins called apartments of the aisle never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow the staff were very professional and did not bother us until breakfast time breakfast was just ok with limited options but this was ok for us the a is clearly the benchmark in long haul first class flight and on this occasion ba provided a high quality service

2008, we flew melbourne to singapore via sydney on september with british airways our preferred airline is etihad but we decided to try ba as we secured a very competitive first fare i have never flown ba before but have heard not so good reports so was a bit apprehensive we were delighted with the service from qantas ba flys out of syd in melbourne in booking our bags through to singapore the boarding in syd was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew the first is a configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen departure was on time and the hour flight up to singapore was very smooth cabin staff were very helpful and attentive the was ample room to stretch out although we did not makeup the sleeping option as we were connecting in singapore to go on to lhr the food was lovely as was the choice of wine and drinks in summary we were delighted with the service and flight

2010, san jose london heathrow san jose in september in premium economy was so excited when british airways announced the new san jose service earlier this year driving up the to sfo had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested so was relieved to book out of sjc a ten minute drive from home my only one gripe with ba is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in premium economy night before travel i was unable to select a seat during on line check in so next day i proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available due to over booking was provided an compensation credit card to fly the following day which i gladly accepted the boeing is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route was given juice upon boarding and a hot towel only one drink service after take off and only one shot of whiskey was provided dinner service included a choice from the club world cabin menu full english breakfast prior to landing return trip given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel lunch was a filet of beef mid flight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza cabin crew were ok and nothing exceptional on both sectors overall a good trip

2012, bahrain to boston via london first time flying ba after flying qatar emirates and oman air business class check in at bah was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area ba uses the dilmun lounge which is basic but adequate the flight from bah to lhr was on a the seats are in a x x configuration and are very narrow similar to premium economy seats and marginally larger than the economy seats though reasonably comfortable when fully flat there is not much room and people over feet will struggle there was hardly any storage space and the ife screen was very small and of poor quality the food was very average i had the carrot and pumpkin soup cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired the lounge in heathrow is large but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably the bathrooms in both the main ba lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get the quality of food in the lounge is average though the wine and spirit selection is decent the flight from lhr to bos was on a and this was similar to the old and tired with cramped seating for business class cabin crew were a bit better on this leg though still disengaged the food was of average quality though the wine list while small was good overall ba has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts the lounge is sub par particularly when compared to the qatar lounge in doha or even the qantas one world lounge in lax the business class ticket was reasonably cheap though i can now see why given the choice i would not fly ba again

2016, my husband and i flew from atlanta to london and it was a nightmare experience first the flight was delayed of hours and since we had to make a connection in london to go to geneva we only had minutes do so and it was a nightmare no one to helped us we had to run like crazy in the airport we had to pass security and immigration one more time we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to geneva as it was about to close is door i was shocked that british airways did not provide us with any assistance obviously they do not care about their customers on our way back the flight from geneva to london was late by more than minutes and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to atlanta we flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom when you are in premium economy there is only one bathroom for about people and it is a shared one with people in economy the food is non existent one ounce of salad and four once of a so called meal dessert and watery coffee you will be left hungry so don t rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment we paid for this trip and i regret choosing this airline premium economy is not worth the extra fee you only get inches more than in economy but that s it you will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy that s it i will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in london heathrow please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and british airways flights are late the only positive thing i must mention is that employees on the plane were very gentle polite and nice to talk to but other than that everything else with british airways was off not worth the price nor the headache 
2017, we flew from hartsfield jackson atlanta to london heathrow on september nd and i have to say it was the worst experience i have had flying when we got onto the plane there was no room for one of our bags at all so we had to put it under our feet keeping in mind this was a hour flight as uncomfortable as it was i said i would try get some sleep when i opened the blanket there were long black hairs stuck to it the seats were ripped too when the meals came out i didn t get offered one hours into the flight i asked the lady for a mineral i am still waiting 
2018,abu dhabi to london british airways is usually a very organised airline they do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seats even if we fly business class this is something that i and every sensible person would consider as utter madness i did not pay a penny and managed to get an aisle seat for my auh lhr leg on my trip boarding was chaotic although this is nothing to do with ba but its the airport mess staff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of time on departure we were given a light snack and before arrival a full english breakfast overall a comfortable flight

2020, london heathrow to johannesburg return outward leg was full seat downstairs on the aisle i am tall and there is not much leg room plane was clean and crew efficient evening meal of chicken and rice was passable departed and landed on time i was actually en route to botswana so time to connect with that flight return leg was not full seat upstairs and it seemed quieter no passenger in window seat so i had aisle and window to myself but the arm rest between the seats only goes up half way seems a ba design feature and is annoying this crew seemed to be in a race to complete the dinner service again chicken and rice days after outward trip and not as well prepared the cabin crew were trying to serve coffee in the middle of the meal in order to disappear as fast as possible they reappeared at breakfast which was the ba version of a full english as it was on the outward trip something yellow which pretended to be egg but the rest was ok landed on time cabin crew seemed younger than usual and maybe they needed a senior to point out to them that hurrying the serving of meals is too obvious and not what we pay for 
2021, abu dhabi to heathrow return probably one of the worst flight travel experiences me and my family have had to endure from what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the uk to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly british airways again first when checking in in abu dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new boeing of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at am for check in the actual flight time was then the plane was delayed yet again british airways staff were no where to be found eventually a supposed british airways manager arrived we then couldn t check in because the system was broken after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in uni arriving at heathrow two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for uni was missing apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is again no communication from british airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone sad thing is that in the move to uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag when we explained this to the ba phone operator she was told that was probably not the wisest decision thank you ba for the great advice now sitting on the plane returning to home to abu dhabi same plane days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine great you found the leak but a new plane all these problems seriously british airways should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world 
2022, gatwick to malaga aircraft on remote stand at gatwick north terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and boarding via steps without cover not bad this early am as just overcast but dark and chilly waiting to board aircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back of seat leather and generally dirty pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to csd threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved well dealt with by cabin staff very noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language spoken to by other passengers and told to desist the food just gets worse each trip i fly with them muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard is this really the best they can do finally to round off flight a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights i have ever taken with ba cabin staff great but product is poor 
2023, on a flight leaving at the advertised snack consisted of a choice of crisps a two biscuit pack or a very small packet of nuts these and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantial british airways need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flights or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available as do their low cost competitors

2025, flew from london heathrow to seattle poor boarding procedure at t with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not econ seemed about full sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about hours of taking off cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers travelling with children who didn t like the only option offered so much frustration with british airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price complained to customer service after arriving home and was told the caterer at lhr was to blame and they didn t want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated hard to recommend ba but given the competition on this route and the desire to stay with one world ba ffp it s a poor choice 
2026, london heathrow to budapest it seems british airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that it s turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices i only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths refusing to change my seat because that s what the computer has allocated boarding was the now expected shambles the no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium on this flight several were removed from lockers and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front thus severely restricting leg room cabin staff were rude and uncaring again now the norm for ba the in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea the seats are very narrow allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passengers 
2027, i am a regular traveller on many airlines and a one world emerald ff british airways flight ba from lhr to athens on th september was by far the worst cabin crew that i have encountered in years of flying the crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in business class and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area after hours in the air we were offered a drink the champagne was undrinkable and the crew gave me a gin and tonic after that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible that was all the service we received on the whole flight of hours no top up of drinks no offer of water and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking i even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft and received no reply
2028, gatwick to bilbao british airways migrating to southern terminal and it causes a chaos everyone is used to flights being constantly delayed in gatwick however with silver tier membership or flying business one expects to wait in a ba lounge ba does not have a lounge now instead they are using no lounge subject to capacity and when flights are delayed there is no capacity even for business class passengers does ba ground staff care about it the computer says no attitude prevails together with the usual ba familiarity and sorry that means nothing try to be more professional and show some respect now the customer service is non existent and no one cares about anything if i want no frills i fly easyjet 
2029, ba club europe london heathrow istanbul london heathrow over a weekend check in at t quick as was priority security used the galleries south lounge which while very busy was okay with a few breakfast food options away from the main terminal boarding organised on to a pretty old however seat a clean and comfortable departed a little late but caught up the time with on time arrival crew very good friendly and chatty one of ba s assets food served was also nice lots of drink runs on the hr min flight check in on the return again quick as was the priority security lane otherwise istanbul ataturk airport is not my favourite its crowded dirty the lounge used by ba is one of the worst not worth the trouble of finding boarding through gate organised seat a old but clean and comfortable departed about hour late good food service from a nice crew arriving lhr on time although the flight arrived on to the furthest possible gate and immigration not ba s fault took so long with huge queue which meant over hour getting landside good service will continue to use british airways if the price is right 
2030, madrid to perth via singapore so disappointed with ba really useless airline flight delayed on arrival to london hours and no reason given missed connecting flight to perth from singapore was given pay in lounge access and this was better than nothing but i wonder why they couldn t have just given me access to their lounge i decided to give them a chance since avoiding ba qf flying between australia and europe but i never will again pay to reserve seats pay to request meal i guess ba is positioning itself as a budget airline but its price doesn t reflect that yet it s a shame as i enjoy the transit through singapore rather than the gulf states meal service was alright food good and the service also okay but they chatted in the galley most of the flight and didn t serve drinks they were quite a cheerful bunch at least check in process was smooth all in all 
2031, miami to london heathrow with british airways in first class the boarding process at miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting world traveller plus club world and first class to all join the queue to board despite flying first class it took minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard the crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats the hot towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water the hot nuts were served minutes after the drinks the meal was dry and of poor quality the cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served it was cold and inedible when the crew member made my bed up i was informed they had run out of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after i complained about the poor experience to the csm based on this experience ba s penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for first class save yourself some money because united airlines economy class is better than what i experienced on this flight 
2032, we flew as a group of from heathrow to krakow in club europe the aircraft was clean and newish so had the new economy seats in the club section i would like to know who at british airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in club i know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but i would prefer a bigger seat to sit in maybe ba should have a look at turkish airlines biz cabin the service outbound was just adequate one drinks round then a dinner service ba which was edible but slopping dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger in all the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating now for the return what a joke nn lounge at krakow that s right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet the flight was delayed by nearly hours so by the time boarding started it was a scrum priority boarding abandoned to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up british airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits once on the plane the same tiny seats although we were winners all round as we managed to bag a and c so at least we had some leg room the meal service on this leg really did make me giggle the steward offered a shriveled chicken salad leg meat skewers or get this a boxed sandwich i actually had to ask if that was it he replied yes to which i replied so who s eaten all the food he laughed and actually said we were lucky and if i had any food with me could he have some and i m not making this up once at lhr it took h for the bags to turn up by which time the pod service to the parking had stopped and that turned into a complete drama but i won t go there on this ocassion so what did we get for our club fare to krakow in my opinion very little and what we did get was rubbish if anyone is thinking of going to krakow with ba my advice is save your money and fly economy with another airline and spend the saving having fun there in fact choose another airline since ba on this route are just a joke i have been club europe hundreds of times over the last years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once i have used up my k avios it ll be bye bye ba for good i will only use avios to get first long haul as that gets you the best return on them

2035, flew london heathrow to miami return with ba then onto bogota with avianca british airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight i only just boarded the aircraft on time on both flights they ran out of one of the food options leaving only the vegetarian dish they onboard entertain system was low quality a small screen with poor resolution seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines i ve flown in economy their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance i had connected from mia to bog with avianca they are a much better airline seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality and they had usb charging in economy shows how far ba have fallen when they re being outdone by the colombian national carrier if it wasn t for the better price i would have preffered direct flights with avianca

2037, british airways is getting worse online check in what s the point if you cannot choose seats no warm food on any of my recent flights except transatlantic yet the prices still don t reflect this moreover when i asked for a warm tea as well as a can of coke on board the flight attendant looked like he was doing me a favour for giving drinks as opposed to just one at least i didn t take the crisps offered to me always late when flying in or out of gatwick which might be due to the airport 
2038, london heathrow to larnaca i went into the british airways app on my phone seconds after online check in opened and totally disappointed to see only seats available to choose from this is the second time this has happened with british airways in the last few months who really should not be offering an online check in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection i called them to enquire why they do this to which the reply was that most seats are restricted on online check in they did sort the seat i wanted however as i m flying with my mother who obviously i want to be sat next to yet when i looked yesterday at the option of paying for a seat reservation before online check in opens there was a good choice available if british airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying then they should abolish the online check in as it s clearly not providing the service it should do online check in means being able to choose from several seats not being unacceptably limited to seat choices only just seconds after online check in has opened 
2039, no online check in is available from dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport lounge in dubrovnik is ok but refreshments poor but better than being in the busy main departures area the in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing no priority boarding cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay no newspapers available when there are only rows in business you would thing ba could provide them in the premium cabin so called brunch was served which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato lettuce leaf and cucumber very poor for what is scheduled as just under a hour flight this to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how ba expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets cabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business is it that difficult very poor show and think we will look at alternatives next time 
2040, took a domestic flight from knoxville to atlanta for onward british airways flight to heathrow went to ba to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so i needed to resolve it with my travel agent check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent lounge in atlanta was mediocre at best flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren t anything special i d say ba first class is average at best when compared to emirates or singapore airlines my baggage didn t arrive at heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with ba lost baggage it was finally delivered almost a week later overall not the kind of service that you would expect when flying first class raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks and four follow up calls to customer relations who said that since my agent had booked my knoxville flight that was due to land in atlanta less than hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to heathrow their system automatically took my booking off i don t know whether this is normal but i ve never come across this issue before in all my years of flying absolutely awful customer service ba have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isn t good enough not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins which is atrocious needless to say won t be flying with them again if i can help it

2042, early flight from gatwick to dubrovnik check in reasonably quick although only one desk at business class check in new fast track security was quick number one lounge was busy but we had a reasonable choice of seats refreshments ok on boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat c and my wife a they were very dirty nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth but not good enough hot breakfast was ok cabin crew were very good flight landed on time into dubrovnik but our bags were about the last through so priority clearly doesn t work a bit disappointing really 
2043, london heathrow to hong kong very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for ba service to hkg on september th i was buying my ticket in april so early as ba executive club gold member i had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type d on upper deck at time of buying the ticket in ams when checking in for that flight this seat was still granted hours later at gate i was reallocated to g on main deck first no explanation then that they could make a family happy to sit together but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not no other seat available due to a full flight just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to b a seat a little further away from the restrooms but still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck i have gotten already ec tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me i am so regularly flying with them they know my preferences upper deck aisle seat and as much in front as possible i am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person but upon their reaction i guess this was not the case communication is marketing and this was very bad done by ba this time why should i be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits especially concerning their reservation policy that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together the flight itself was aside from odor and noise uneventful the cabin crew very pleasant 
2044, amsterdam to heathrow swift checkin security and passport control lounge with a nice view but it might have a little larger drink and food selection incoming plane late for about minutes boarding for minutes but on time arrival boarding process a little chaotic was moved to c because on my seat was the husband of a handicapped woman they served their afternoon tea with sandwich and scones which was delicious seat comfortable pitch on the small side business class bus transport to lhr terminal main building 
2045, porto to london third time flying on this route with ba and always boarding with a minimal delay of hour poor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flight ba recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions

2048, the many problems i had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return on arrival at t from another carrier i went to the ba baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet ba cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal t the agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble fast track security was woefully slow and incompetent when i arrived at the gate boarding had commenced though i had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service i had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite management s false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a kg limit for the is also one of the most generous despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty i was forced to check my bag carry on compliant bag the flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agent s unwarranted behavior the flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering in all a waste of money for ba s vaulted business class experience the recent economist article about ba s race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management s hostility towards customers and especially ba and ow elites the asterisk on the oneworld baggage page singles out ba as the only carrier in the group who will not allow it s own elite fliers and those on ow to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare ba offers as the economist article stated loyalty is very easy to lose but extremely difficult to re attain 
2049, london to moscow i was supposed to travel with ba today i had a previous flight coming from dallas which was a little late as soon as no one met me at the arrival i assumed that i have plenty of time and did not rush to the gate when i arrived to the gate mins before closing the lady said that ba moved me to another flight because this flight was full and my previous plane delayed i was really surprised because there were a lot of passengers still at the gate and i was not the last one i asked if the company will compensate me for the cancellation because i will miss another connecting flight in moscow she said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the company s fault after what she said that i am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that ba transferred me to ba i asked why and she said that i should listen and then i ll understand i listened again but could not understand few things still why no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being late why she admitted that the plane was full so my place was given to someone else without asking me why at least she didn t say sorry even once and continued to insist on her version that it was not fault of the company is it really something that ba treats as a normal practice 
2050, munich to cape town via heathrow the aircraft was very old with outdated tv screens uncomfortable seats and an air conditioning system which settles dust on air vents food was ok nothing exciting but when breakfast was served it was started way too late so by the time the food was served there was no time to serve any tea and coffee 
2051, vienna london gatwick porto in march in economy vie lgw o minutes early lgw opo almost on time after a minutes departure delay web check did not work after having entered all the required personal and passport details manually the system informed me that no web check in is offered for this flight quite irritating as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedure having oneworld sapphire status i used the manned premium check in counter and was able to score an aisle window seat this worked fine with no lines but required to be at the airport earlier than intended as ba charges extra for all seat selections even for a middle seat at the back of the plane boarding for both flights was fine and hassle free service on the vie lgw leg was rather lacklustre for ba but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck as per usual for ba great much better fa s on the lgw opo leg and again flight deck excellent full bar service on both flights and a sandwich was served as well ba uses a shared lounge in vie which is on the poor side rather small and cramped with limited food options however the hot item of the day tends to be of good quality snacks and drinks fall in the discount category lounge experience in lgw was very unsatisfactory ba closed their own lounge at lgw to give up the space for another airline s lounge and uses pay per entry no lounge which was so crowded that even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge furthermore food and alcoholic drinks have to be ordered at the slightly chaotic bar off a menu food is then delivered to your seat a time consuming process in a lounge that is filled beyond capacity my understanding is that this arrangement will last well into before ba opens up a new lounge why ba gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me overall solid experience in the air but not so good on the ground will consider ba for further travel in economy short haul if fares are competitive but will avoid departing from lgw as for business class i have stopped using ba a while ago due to the condensed seating arrangements on both short haul and long haul flights

2055, flew british airways from london heathrow to larnaca cabin crew excellent cheerful and helpful food and drink good let down by aircraft business class seats are identical to economy little recline ife was not working for the whole plane for the whole flight in any case ife was one small screen in the bulkhead with no choice of content business cabin is normally rows thru but was extended back to row meaning we had to share the two lavatories with economy section flight left late but arrived almost on time an ok flight but the business offer is not worth the extra cost would recommend ba but not on this route boarding on outbound and inbound flight chaotic with priority going to families with babies of which there were very very many 
2056, i wanted to fly ba s boeing to shanghai the ground handling at terminal was very efficient a little surprised that we had to take a bus to the aircraft and walk up the stairs but the boarding process was swift and completed mins before schedule the seats were a disappointment they felt slightly harder and more narrow than the seats on older emirates a cx or lufthansa a screens were a bit smaller legroom was about the same ba doesn t spoil it s economy passengers here the boeing is quite silent but the a is even a bit more silent during the flight however this is where the criticism ends the plane was spotless food was excellent the best thing was the crew smiling and helpful and professional overall the high standards of the crew would be my reason to prefer ba over the competitors

2060, lisbon to heathrow on british airways i booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when i went to check in online the ba website said i had been sold a seat only flight the travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance i called ba and was messed around by their staff member i had to pay an outrageous fee to have bag of only kg fly in the hold with me to london at lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike the departure board did not show the check in area for the ba flights i had to find my own way to where ba check in i joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check in staff allowed a woman with kids to queue jump when other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing the check in lady i dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful the departure from lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat the cabin crew were very professional the departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served my seat was very comfortable and the drop down screens showed the route followed arrival was minutes ahead of schedule baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags when things go well ba is excellent however charges for baggage are outrageous and place ba in the same category as budget airlines i give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin crew though 
2061, gatwick to marrakech with my family for a day holiday first timer on british airways pros flight on time comfortable seats generous luggage allowance easy online check in hrs before pleasant flight con meal i thought they would provide proper hot meals i e rice and curry however route london to marrakech and vice versa only one type of cold meal sandwich is served also small chocolate dessert biscuit and the usual tea coffee or drink is provided unfortunately i could not have the meal as i do not eat anything with added sugar toilets only saw toilets which was rather over used and busy entertainment tv none i expected seats to be built in with tvs so that kids could be busy and entertained this was like a no frills airline thankfully kids had their tablets with them staff okay but could be bit more friendly and approachable a smile would make the difference return flight airplane was bit dirty i noticed crips bags tucked under the chair overall a star airline in my opinion

2064, i have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew over the years british airways first has gone so far downhill i m afraid it just can t compete anymore it needn t be so as the issues as i see them are all resolvable however the return leg was like flying with ryanair there were only people in the cabin there were no slippers of the menu items i requested were in the words of the crew invisible and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me my father waited the entire flight having asked on seperate occasions for a headset convertor we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast which i then missed assuming i would be woken there was a palpable tension between the crew which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers once we had disembarked the aircraft it was a further minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked finally we collect our suitcases which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim only to find of the had broken wheels ba have subsequently supplied new replacement suitcases when comparing the service food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound ba just doesn t cut the mustard any longer i m afraid such as shame as the seats bed are great but why pay the extra for service and food that just isn t forthcoming or varies from flight to flight 
2065, berlin txl to london heathrow with british airways after purchasing ticket i could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status i called ba times the first times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system after the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made at check in i spent more than minutes online trying to pay the junk fee for a single piece of luggage again i had to call ba times to get a bag checked onto my flight of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junk fee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound the second call was to get a refund and rebook the junk fee the third call was to complain about spending hours checking in and correcting ba s mistakes i spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee the ba lounge at txl is small and does not have a toilet there were no warm food items on offer i did find the service to be good boarding commenced at the farthest point at berlin tegel from the ba lounge flight was okay with minimal amenities ba not only does not compete on price but amazingly no longer competes on service 
2066, warsaw to london heathrow i fly the route regularly and i have noticed decline in the ba level of service boarding in warsaw is chaotic no priority boarding rules enforced basically boarding started for everone at the same time no matter you fly premium or are a frequent flyer new ba short haul seats are not really comfortable fine for h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer same concerns meals provided crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for h flight i would rather cut on free alcohol and have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to buy further food if necessary on the plus side cabin service very well trained and attentive the waw to lon route is served with other carriers including budget ones and i will have hard time justify paying a premium to fly ba on this route in the future

2068, the british airways experience has really declined over the past years i often fly business class and at least premium economy the boeing is awesome clean spacious and excellent technology media options however the staff and service has declined rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs they are on automatic pilot we travel with children and the stroller has become a real problem firstly they gave a kg maximum on weight try getting a kg stroller that works in canadian weather so we bought a new light stroller however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends try travelling with a year old through the chaos of terminal in the summer months without a stroller with a tight hour lay over we waited over minutes for our stroller the only reason we got it ground staff forgot was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it the younger staff could care less and left us and other families alone waiting they could learn a lot from the pilot also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving hours late a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it the good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well anyway they have to improve i fly with family members every year to italy this time we are using klm or lufthansa and another bonus us we can avoid heathrow terminal

2074, abuja to london heathrow this flight took off and landed on time the jack on the new style headphones didn t fit in the socket so if i wanted to listen to anything i had to sit and hold the jack in place there was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers the meal served before landing was a choice between a mini kitkat or a mini mars bar a far cry from the scone jam and cream of a couple of years ago and even worse than the bruschetta mini breadsticks tomato salsa packet of mixed nuts and celebrations of a couple of months ago don t even get me started on the disgusting muffin that has replaced the salmon and egg roll as the meal before landing on the outward journey the toilets were not checked as often as they should have been and i had to inform the cabin crew that there was no toilet roll left very disappointing 
2075, london heathrow to istanbul return the outbound flight was delayed approx hours which was very frustrating boarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there was confusion around seating arrangements once we were finally off the ground the onboard entertainment was great and the flight was quite smooth the food was terrible tomato and egg sandwich with other little tit bits return leg was on time but the check in queue was horrendous the flight left on time on board entertainment was a struggle as we did not have individual monitors and we were offered tomato and egg sandwiches again as a meal i hope that this experience is not repeated in october on our trip to the caribbean but either way i will come back to give an honest opinion we will be flying premium economy so will expect to have far fewer complaints let s wait and see 
2076, the flight from london heathrow to krakow with british airways was slightly delayed but arrival on time standard economy class service nothing to write home about but efficient pm flight to arrive at pm but served only a pack of chips with a drink not even a sandwich for this hour flight there is nothing to be purchased on ba i believe this flight time should justify at least a sandwich that ba served on my previous experience 
2077, i was booked to travel british airways from heathrow to dublin airport in ireland i arrived at the airport within the permitted check in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue i went to a check in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues i was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt the woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments i asked her if there was a problem she nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass after mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help it was bizarre i joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person i dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings he made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate boarding was not efficient one would expect better from ba the queue was poorly managed the cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional one cabin crew member an older lady was superb and i saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from japanese people with limited english this member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline my seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor the captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop down screen to show the route of the flight a cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered my bag did not arrive into dublin with me and so i had to join a queue for swissport this is where my nightmare started a uniformed woman who said she represented ba told me my bag would most likely not arrive until tomorrow i asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that i leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where i was staying i took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight over the next few days a nightmare began i spent many hours calling swissport and their courier dpd to be fair the dpd staff were helpful and told me the reference number from swissport was wrong swissport insisted the reference number was correct 
2078, london heathrow vancouver london heathrow first impressions could have been better as this flight departs from terminal rather than terminal at heathrow the departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates however the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it once on board i found the cabin to be very clean unlike many airlines ba offers economy seating upstairs on the a where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft however the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual which could be an issue for those with roller cases the ife system provided is excellent i also ordered one of ba s new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal this option was well worth taking up offering an improved choice and quality the service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where british airways seems to do consistently well if i have a criticism it is that the inch seat pitch seems miserly for a hour flight arrival at vancouver was on time and i was through immigration and landside in about minutes processing through security for departure from yvr was equally efficient the return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one although arrival in london was an hour late however the relatively quiet cabin on the a meant that i was able to get some sleep unfortunately the arrival experience at lhr terminal was no better than the departure one a lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow moving snaking line to clear immigration a marked contrast to the experience at yvr 
2079, flew london heathrow to washington dc the business class cabin on a british airways a is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row most other international carriers i ve flown limit themselves to no more than four or at most five seats per row in business class in the ba configuration passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed also the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes and the seats are claustrophobically narrow by far the worst business class seats i ve ever encountered 
2080, i fly this route times a year unfortunately there is no competition other than air canada i ve had occasional problems rude staff freezing planes poor service but generally been satisfied on this last flight a week ago the plane has been internally reconfigured and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately of the space and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal sized adult i have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space i offered to send ba this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint see below the discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of hours for which i did not blame the airline meaning i spent hours in that position rather than hours then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar approximately inches in size as a result i arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after pm and would have brought food on the flight had i known of the miserly cost cutting measure in advance i wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration as this can t easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again i ended my complaint saying i had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers i ve just received a response which is clearly a cut and pasted reply about the hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint indicating that it was not even read and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy which is particularly shortsighted as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances and we won t forget how we were treated

2082, flew british airways from boston to berlin via london pleasant flight not as comfortable as the plane flying out in july but still nicer than the old plane i m used to flying into san diego the entertainment screen options were much more extensive than i ve had before so i m not sure if the different route made a difference or a different plane the crew were kind and unobtrusive food was completely tomato based which was very strange as usually they offer more varied options overall good flight 
2083, flew london gatwick to tampa ba club world business class is a great way to travel unfortunately due to renovations at lgw british airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn t as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete i m sure that standard will be resumed on boarding it was nice to be welcomed back a small but nice touch straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks warm towels and our menu choices ba does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic one of the things i really love about ba is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew the more senior members really do know their stuff the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks drinks are available between the regular drink meal service the only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the ife which really does need an update i know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft as an aviation enthusiast a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight ba my airline of choice
2084, outbound heathrow frankfurt on ancient british airways with old business class seats etc aircraft was filthy dirty with wires hanging down why do they fly such wrecks inbound frankfurt heathrow on a british airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray club europe the seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seats the flight attendant was grumpy rude and sullen i accept this was a short flight but how british airways get away with calling this business class is beyond me they should be cited for trade descriptions i wonder if any ba senior executives bother to fly their so called premium classes 
2085, dublin to san francisco via philadelphia my international ba business class return flight was rebooked by ba to american airlines instead of the second leg of the flight being the fully reclining seats with movies electronics and lots of space as advertised and paid for like my first flight the second leg was a domestic flight which had a business class seat which reclined about no movies no electronics etc as it was an older plane it would have been fine had i not paid top dollar for all the amenities i submitted a complaint and asked for a partial voucher but to no avail the customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversations the final straw was when i contacted my travel agent and had them call ba on my behalf ba told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgrade really ba changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities what is so irrating is the cost was over for each ticket and i was not provided the service or flight i paid for false advertising 
2086, mexico to amsterdam via london with british airways awful experience my baggage is delayed since tuesday august they told me that my pieces of lugagge were going to arrive the next day i ve been waiting and nothing has been received yet i even paid for the upgrated seats to ensure a good care with my luggage will be given however everything has been very dissapointing my first experience with british airways has been awful 
2087, i was flying zurich to baltimore via london with my cello and had booked one seat for me and an extra seat for the cello the booking was made online and then verified over the phone directly with british airways i asked the ba customer support agent if the cello booking would be okay and he told me there is no problem you have the additional seat booked simply turn up at check in and you will have no problems ba denied me boarding because their system required not only me but also the cello seat needs to have an esta visa they were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system after hours of stress at check in they denied me boarding and quoted me over to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey i made an official complaint and they replied basically confirming no refund i am appalled my their total lack of customer service and will never fly with them again 
2088, singapore to sydney return on a british airways fifth freedom route boarding for the outgoing flight ba from singapore was a bit disorganised and there was congestion on the aerobridge on board the aircraft had an air conditioning problem so the cabin was quite warm seats were fairly comfortable with a fairly narrow seat pitch and the entertainment selection was fairly good bar service commenced minutes after departure the chicken main meal was pretty good but would have preferred dinner to be served hour and not hours into the flight prior to arrival i received a snack box which contained a really bad sandwich granola bar and some yoghurt cabin crew didn t offer a regular drinks service on this flight return flight to singapore ba was a notch better boarding in sydney was done in a more efficient manner bar and main meal service was quicker although evidence of ba s cost cutting can be seen as they ve now removed cheese and crackers from the main meal cabin crew did do two rounds of drinks service on this flight and were more attentive good sandwich for the snack dinner service before arrival late departures on both flights but arrivals into sydney and singapore were on time still good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flights very satisfied with this ba flight and service especially when their full service competitors charge around more on sydney flights and budget challengers aren t up to the mark with the price and service 
2089, london heathrow to nassau return with british airways avios tickets for me and my wife great cabin crew on both sectors particularly the first as it was a day time flight so we gave them more to do and had more interaction food was pretty uninspiring and the wine list limited but we did manage to find things that kept us pretty happy disappointingly they did not have enough champagne on the return sector for anything other than a pre flight drink crew said it had been busy on the way out and they were unable to replenish the bars at their destination grand cayman lie flat bed is comfortable flights on time and bags delievered to the carousel fairly quickly 
2090, miami to london heathrow with british airways busy check in at mia this being explained by broken windscreen on flight ba which led to their passengers being rebooked our own flight ba was befallen by a damaged tyre which took hours to fix the admiral lounge at mia was reasonable the flight left late and staff provided reasonable cabin service toilets constantly used by economy class passengers which left them less clean than usual and less readily available slept well on flat bed breakfast was ok they had to manage missed transfers as a result of the delayed arrival and the staff seemed well prepared for this baggage damaged one item and lost two items i watched the ground crew at mia unload the a from the gate after it arrived and i can state that in some cases they literally flung the cases onto the ground from the hold i suspect this explains the matter 
2091, doha to paris cdg via bahrain and london premium economy is really good the return flight to cdg via bah and lhr was more than a direct flight in qatar economy class yes it also stops over in bahrain and it s not direct to paris but it was well worth it bigger seat great food and better ife than qatar i could use the emerald lounge at lhr t so landing from doha i can shower and have breakfast before the short hop to paris i think there are plenty of passengers from qatar willing to pay extra for premium economy rather than shell out for business class originating in doha ba will fly direct from doha in a couple of months 
2092, sao paulo to heathrow with british airways tam lounge at guarulhos t is one of my favourites boarded on time seat k cabin very empty about people in first ba first service is fabulous each passenger was welcomed and spoken to individually by the flight manager which i thought was a nice touch the ba s are all in my experience quite tired looking however i will be sad to see the back of them when the s arrive on this route in a couple of months the first cabin looks nice but it doesn t feel like a first class environment the food was at best ordinary the menu was not very inspiring the main course was simply dreadful dry chicken the whole meal was not exciting as i would expect from a first class dinner service very good wine champagne selection inflight entertainment poor ba have great staff but prices are very high across all cabins and i am sorry to say on this flight it was not worth it

2094, london heathrow to miami in club world lounge at terminal was busy and slightly cramped with basic food offerings flight left on time a club world layout was roomy however slightly inferior cabin service for example no hot towels no drinks menu etc food quality was good the club world kitchen content was poor and inadequate when i visited they had only ice cream on offer seat comfortable and slept well when used as a bed baggage damaged on arrival overall a reasonable flight a superior product compared to north american carriers however inferior in comparison to middle eastern airlines 
2095, athens to kuala lumpur via london heathrow the lounge in athens was basic and the furniture was very worn and needed replacement the first flight to lhr was on an a basic economy seats for a hour flight not great but the meal was excellent and crew efficient ba lounge at t is large and busy with plenty of quiet areas to relax amenities there are fine and in line with most good airport lounges boeing to kul so everything new excellent food and service unlike some reviews i am a fan of the business seat layout and go for the window seats which provide excellent privacy once the divider is raised

2100, flew bangkok to london it s been a few years since i regularly flew business class with british airways i always used to look forward to the big seats a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit special fast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien the planes are tired with worn out interiors and all of this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experience for better value and added smiles i ve found the premium economy offering must better value for money

2103, british airways ruined our holiday we had a flight from edinburgh to prague via heathrow booked and the flight was minutes late in arriving at lhr therefore we missed our connecting flight and when we approached the ba customer service desk for help the customer service advisor was disinterested smug and extremely unhelpful he even said he was doing me a favour by booking another flight 
2104, we travelled from aberdeen to heathrow and on to san francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom even less legroom than on a local flight to europe ryanair on a hour flight on the return journey the first flight from san francisco to heathrow was delayed once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy so they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were very scary in view of the security situation then our row of seats had no in flight entertainment row the first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink so we travelled for hours with no entertainment on landing at heathrow our next flight to aberdeen was also delayed for one hour on complaining to ba they eventually replied offering us a voucher for pounds not much use if you intend never to fly ba again shocking customer service avoid heathrow and particularly ba at heathrow

2106, london heathrow new york jfk ba first seat k it was very strange to be bussed to the aircraft rather than using an airbridge but this was due to capacity issues i was greeted at the steps of the aircraft taken to my seat handed pyjamas and a wash bag and a glass of champagne the seat was the new first with upgraded panasonic entertainment system i was addressed by name throughout the flight given extra food to try as it was a half full cabin regular top ups for drinks and received a stellar service from a dedicated and professional crew the new entertainment system was great and the buy for you fly service worked as my items were delivered to my seat one of the best flights i ve had for a long time but i always believe it s down to the service

2108, basel to london heathrow with british airways at am i recieved a text telling me that flight ba departing had been cancelled minutes later i recieved a second message telling me that i was rebooked on flight ba a departing on arrival at basel airport i discovered the club class check in doubles as a general enquiry point after a wait of minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers queries were dealt with a rude and unhelpful agent checked me in i asked if the seat c i had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no i had been allocated seat c and the allocation could not be changed seat c remained empty the business lounge was at least superior to the ba one i used on my outward journey being independantly run our incoming flight for ba was delayed leaving heathrow finally landing at pm at pm passengers were informed by the business lounge concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed the flight eventually pushed back from the stand at i wonder if this was a ploy by ba to avoid paying compensation for a hour delay on board we met by profuse apologies from the captain and cabin staff although no no reason for the delay was given certainly not ba s finest hour

2110, london heathrow to boston my complaint is about the service and rudeness of the british airways boarding staff priority boarding lane had over people waiting while no one was in line for the general boarding when i tried to attract the attention of the attendant he addressed me with such rudeness and disregard his words were you are not the only first class passenger and kept ranting even after i left his station this is not acceptable in any situation i cannot believe this just happened will never set foot in another ba flight

2112, sadly british airways business class london heathrow to geneva is no longer worth any extra cost i m only cm and can t sit comfortably and relax without being sideways in addition to chamonix we have homes in london and telluride colorado and ba lost us as customers for quite a few years on the lhr to den service again because of the ridiculous seat forward backward seat configuration in business class that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight therefore we flew air nz much much better flight if a little inconvenient to lax return flights a year and suffered longer on united to get to our destination as ba business was so bad fortunately they now have a on the lhr to den service where we can fly first class which we are using but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service

2115, london heathrow to budapest with british airways i did not choose ba for this flight it was arranged by my cruise tour operator online check in ok bag drop agent surly and unhelpful terminal lounge chaotic tables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and glasses at am in the morning the only food available was stale croissants servers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requested boarding process was the ba chaos i have come to expect why do ba gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagers new club seating is atrocious no better than economy with centre seat empty no drink offered on boarding economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance seat very uncomfortable little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front the only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew where do ba recruit such useless staff and are they specially trained to have no customer focus ba is certainly not my airline of choice many lessons can be learned from their no frills competitors 
2116, the british airways club europe business product is dreadful value for money the lounge in geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed boarding wasn t done by priority just a free for all at the gate fine but nothing special my real issue is with the offering on board no special seats just the middle seat of three left free we were then served a meal of a few lettuce leaves two tomatoes two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken really ba to top it off we were on a remote stand at heathrow and it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us just not worth it on every level

2118, flew london heathrow to bangkok via kuala lumpur and return we resented having to pay just to reserve our seats but that we did and on our way back we decided not as a principle i would suggest british airways should not behave like a no frills airlines your name and brand mean much more than those cheap airlines so please stop charging people extras when they have booked and paid i will come back to fly with you when you have decided to realise your reputation as a honest airline and not like other cheap rate greedy airlines i might be just one customer but one customer s review can t be read by many

2122, absolute appalling service received by british airways i had a morning flight from amsterdam to london which they cancelled for fog the flight was for am and even though the weather was clear by am they refused to book me on another flight until pm not even a meal was offered to me all that time i was in the airport from am till pm that is for over hours and was told it was weather and out of their hands even though they had over flights to london over the period i was shocked by the treatment given the way i held the airline in high esteem to the point that i have now refused to purchase any flight via them or related to them since that time even if the have the cheapest tickets and only direct route 
2123, cannot believe how bad british airways was we arrived very early at the airport in kuala lumpur to catch a flight to london in premium economy they would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why the flight was massively overbooked there are seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by there was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats this is utterly irresponsible very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling we were told by the manager that this happens almost every night not a single employee of british airways was there to manage the situation it was left to the poor malaysia airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it they have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take hours longer they refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation it is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers british airways has lost my business forever

2125, first class flight from london gatwick to st lucia with british airways first lounge at gatwick was being refurbished but there was a temp replacement lounge offered by no which was actually superior to to the old ba one flight left on time and arrived minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise the seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spacious inflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of movies two areas stood out on this flight the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one the next one and i cannot believe i am saying this was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in cw and first it might have been a fluke but having just flown back in business from st lucia the service and food was just as good perhaps ba are finally listening to their customers 
2126, flying in club europe from london city to berlin tegel returning in economy with british airways the outbound flight was delayed for nearly hour however the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable the food offered in the ce cabin was delicious flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare everything went wrong from checking in lounge access baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage i had done my online check in on my return flight just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later i discovered had been incorrectly issued to me she checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine after i dropped off my luggage i went to the business lounge as i am a silver member i provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass however i showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app she didn t even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system she didn t investigate anything and asked me to call up ba which i didn t bother when i was queuing up at the passport control i noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect i approached the ba staff at the gate immediately after i had cleared through security ba staff were shocked that i was checked in under someone else s name wrong name wrong flight etc they asked me to go to the correct gate immediately but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and i might not have it back upon arrival at lcy they gave me a new luggage tag after arriving at lcy waited for mins bag didn t show up i approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone i explained the situation which she didn t really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt insisting my luggage would arrive again no investigation rushed service and a bit rude days later no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage 
2127, british airways flight from baltimore to heathrow was good connecting from heathrow to amsterdam was a disaster they board passagers onto the plane just for them to later find out that the plane was defect the pilot and engineers tried fixing the problem and let us sit inside for hours finally discovered that they couldn t fix it took another min to let us back out to the terminal for us to find solutions ourselves no food after hours of searching for a flight to amsterdam got to amsterdam and my luggage had never been loaded onto the plane

2130, british airways lounge in t was very busy as shared with aa and others but good selection of nibbles and beers spirits and more important to me it was clean and the staff were constantly clearing up after guests who had left the boarding was a very far gate in the satelite area of t and at around the same time we boarding to vancouver a was boarding to las vegas so the area was very congested the announcements of boarding were barely audible the outward bound flight was uneventful great and as smooth a trip as i ve ever had inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at lhr for minutes which spoilt a little the ending the crew both ways were superb and professional the business cabin is pretty basic compared to the middle east carriers but you can get some good sleep food was very good lounge in vancouver was very nice and staff bright and cheery all in all great flights 
2131, london heathrow to atlanta a delayed flight was made worse when the pilot assured us that arrangements were being made for our connecting flight the reality was standing in a line for hours causing us to miss flights with other airlines i will not fly british airways again 
2132, flew marseille to london absolutely terrible service flight delayed four hours check in staff rude and arrogant and didn t explain the delay plane was not that clean the one consolation was the pilot coming out of the cockpit to apologise about the delay and offered the opportunity for passengers to view the inside of the cockpit for the money they charge you can get better service elsewhere i would recommend using other airlines personally 
2133, los angeles to rome via london with british airways our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for each we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco boarding was not well organized our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate which proved to be incorrect information we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad we had to sprint back to gate with minutes until departure when we arrived at that gate we were told we would be bussed to our gate we waited another minutes for buses seats were fairly comfortable food was just okay the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock we arrived in rome almost hours late coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome boarding was chaotic and you couldn t understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff everyone seemed confused snack on board was small but tasty we had to be express serviced through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight no time to catch a snack or use the toilet boarding was in process when we arrived at the gate then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat the back of the seat was very close to your face you had to go horizontal in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests food was pretty good on board entertainment was good service was slow forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london we arrived minutes late to lax i also take exception to the luggage charge per leg of the trip for our nd bag st bag is no charge but round trip charge for the nd bag is very steep 
2134, my wife and i used avios to get two return tickets from london heathrow to johannesburg after having done this and once our business travel plans were clear we later booked a separate ticket using cash for a return from edinburgh to london heathrow when we checked in at jnb we were told we could not check our luggage through to edi because the two sectors were on different but still ba tickets apparently this rule was very quietly introduced by british airways on june the flights themselves were very good but if they want to encourage two gold card holders to use other airlines they are going the right way about it 
2135, flew british airways from london heathrow to bangkok standard of food was very good with lovely wine seat comfort and leg room okay on the downside very small tv screen on the back of the seats the service terrible these people represent the uk i have travelled with every other airline to bangkok and back british airways is the worst 
2136, london heathrow to newark return having just returned from my holiday flying with british airways in their world traveller plus class i thought i would post my review the week before we flew we paid the per person to select our seats so i had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together we flew out of t at lhr one what i think is one of ba s new to newark at am and plane interior looked new and clean we took our seats j and k which were right next to the toilets on our seats we found a small pillow blanket headphones and an amenity kit i had plenty of leg room ok i am and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it he is although our seats were next to the toilets we didn t get disturbed movement or smells once the curtain was pulled between us and world traveller you wouldn t have known we were by the bathrooms we were offered a glass of something fizzy water and juice were also available hot towels were handed out menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert with cheese and biscuits the food was ok it was hot and tasted good the food service was quick and prior to the food served drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal however during food service another drink was also offered so three small bottles of wine for the flight and i was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday as we didn t have anyone behind us we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone as there was a wall behind us we couldn t recline as far back as others but it was comfortable enough luckily for both of us the people in front of us didn t really recline theirs too far the seat was really comfortable and even with my generous back side i felt i had plenty of room although i had loaded up my tablet with films and books i didn t use it at all neither did i use the vast choice of ife i used to hour flight time to have some me time my partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight after food the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing most people me included took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye a sandwich and small chocolate bar tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up in my seat the pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another minutes or so i quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets spending or more minutes in there whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer however the toilets were clean the landing was smooth and we arrived on time i suppose you would say we were minutes early but don t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early on leaving the plane i did have a look at business class and without offending regular business class users i did wonder exactly what you get for your money all the pods looked very tightly packed together 
2137, uneventful british airways flight from gatwick to porto take off delayed by minutes due to french air traffic control strike and route of flight had to be changed to avoid french airspace cabin crew helpful and cheerful snack and drinks provided quite adequate for this short flight seats reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airlines now that ba prices are competitive with many budget airlines this additional leg room becomes important flight arrived a few minutes late at opo but some of the lost time was made up during the flight overall a pleasant flight

2139, we travelled on ba from athens on th of june the flight departed at pm but sat on the tarmac for mins due to bad weather at london nonetheless we only got in minutes late what went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process we had showed up early but was refused check in at club europe the ground attendant at athens was incredibly rude and abrupt if they had explained it to us nicely we would have been fine with it the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a a larger than usual plane when we finally lined up it took a good minutes and more to check in at club europe because for half that time there was only one counter open eventually a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line up eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class the middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat british airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different you couldn t properly enjoy it we were placed on the last row of business class and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin it was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end to be fair i think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments furthermore when asked for a blanket i was refused one on the basis there was none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets how is this fair what principle of seat assignment did they use the last few ba trips to europe have been nightmarish from boarding processes this one in athens was chaotic and unsystematic they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre boarding process we were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our exec club the online check in keeps breaking down and when we tell ba that they tell us to call in laugh out hysterically here in fact the more frequent you are a flyer but not high profile the worse treatment you get i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered later on the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already mins from landing i cannot blame the crew they work with what they get if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy we would have booked economy

2141, i think that british airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going but that is their only achievement having booked our flight from alicante to gatwick i immediately selected and paid for seats in row at a cost of each when i came to check in online hours before the flight i found that we had been moved to row the very back of the plane when i selected change your seat row was not even displayed i am years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane for this reason i am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines i did not and have not received any notification from ba to tell me they had changed the seating nor have i received my money back while waiting to board the plane i received a text message survey on my ba experience so far i participated and gave a summary of the situation i also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did when i got home i gave ba one day to contact me but when they did not i submitted a complaint through their website after some days i got a reply saying would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge we ll be more than happy to see if you re eligible if you complete the following form within days of your flight i cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money failed to deliver and not informed me and automatically refunded my money but with ba you have to claim a refund and then wait while they check your eligibility my family take many flights each year including long hauls to asia needless to say that none of these will ever be on british airways 
2142, new york jfk to london gatwick with british airways excellent flight left more or less on time and even with the interminable taxing at jfk we still arrived on time at london gatwick flight was very busy but the service didn t suffer staff were friendly but professional and the b was clean and in excellent condition couldn t ask for more this was my return flight but the outward flight was just as good credit to british airways there was a woman near me who was terriifed of flying and one of the flight attendants sat with her through the landing poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectly i only booked a week before i flew and the price was very good decent offering of entertainment considering this was economy class any downsides none i can think of 
2143, at the beginning of the year i booked first class seats london kansas usa for myself husband son and year old mother to attend a wedding at that time i also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances at check in they had no wheelchair and called for one after some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum at security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search when i complained the supervisor told me i would not be boarding the flight if i didn t keep quiet once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and i requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane it arrived but i was told i could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there the flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived the staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk on talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence i had spent thousands on the flights i had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn t care and saw mum as a nuisance in the usa the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and i was allowed to accompany her all the way to add insult to injury on the flight back half the tv sets didn t work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep my mum refuses to fly ba again and if it wasn t for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to virgin and other carriers i have complained to ba but as of yet no response 
2144, for those who have alluded to there being haves and have nots on ba flights in terms of customer service i can assure them this is not the case i am a gold executive club member and can confirm that i have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins my last experience was with my wife flying from london gatwick to faro on the may checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful ba employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight the lounges that are available whilst the ba lounges are renovated were packed and filthy the ba lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn t access the clubrooms that were full the flight was late and chaotic a group of loud boisterous men were virtually running the economy cabin roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits this resulted in my wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic it turned out to be a lie when the purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a g t on a tray returned home days later and complained received a jumbled response cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced they didn t seem to care so good luck to them

2149, very good flight back to london from barbados bridgetown barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the exec lounge is good with reasonable snacks given the time of day mid late afternoon and a decent selection of drinks available aircraft was clean and it looked as if the club world cabin had recently received some tlc entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of movies and very clear screen no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been given bar service was good and the food was tasty good portion sizes the cheesecake for dessert was almost too much being a night flight the crew got the bar and food service completed early in the flight allowing passengers to get some sleep before the lights came back up for breakfast breakfast was good cabin crew were excellent friendly and efficient cockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the trip previous flights i have taken from lgw have shown a noticable difference in the cabin interiors compared to flights form lhr so it was good to see the lgw fleet getting some needed enhancements 
2150, london heathrow to miami with british airways awful experience changed our flight from a morning flight to an evening flight on the way out and refused to refund the difference as we were put on a cheaper flight then cancelled our return flight without informing us so had to spend an hour of our final evening on holiday speaking to an advisor the plane on the way out was very old many tv s broken and very uncomfortable staff are extremely unhelpful and will never use ba ever again 
2151, every flight we took in british airways for our two vacation flights had huge problems always delayed from ny a hour delay in line computer glitch they were handwriting boarding passes another leg check in was botched their issue and we had to stand with the very rude employee who botched it all up and kept trying to call his manager who never picked up for minutes which held up a very long line of check ins we are here at heathrow tired and ready for our way home already a hour delay no explanation just read that british airways had to turn a plane around this morning due to engine issues

2153, on the th may i reviewed british airways flight from bangkok to london which was not great with a score given after changing the return flight we opted to travel a to singapore very pleased to say that overall the experience was excellent the premium economy product on this aircraft is fantastic seat pitch entertainment unit overall comfort was good the food was ok but i think attention to detail is lacking to polish off this product st meal you receive has metal cutlery yet the second meal is plastic only a minor negative the crew were ok did their job and that was it love the a layout with premium economy on the upperdeck 
2154, i would have been very disappointed indeed if i had paid a full fare for my business class ticket the food was just appalling i could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course beef was hard tasteless and very small compared to business class meals in say cathay pacific or qatar airways portions on both starter and main were around less incredibly british airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route where they make most of their money i was hungry after the meal so later on decided to raid the larder but they only had sweet which i generally avoid the menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available the fas were embarrassed and got me some cheese plus were excellent service good selection of ife and comfortable enough seats a larger pillow would do although i hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat british airways revamped iberia after they merged but now iberia has a much better business class product

2159, we arrived at gatwick just after to catch the flight to st lucia check in was fine and although security was tight we were airside just after before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at after tea and toast we checked at and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed the on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at at this point i did venture down to the british airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people i gave up and sat down again at the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of during all of this time i should add that at no time was any information other than the screen made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc despite numerous announcements from easyjet and other airlines ba was conspicuous by its silence we were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced despite the rather cramped departure area everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area eventually we boarded just after when everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn t been completed and a further delay was likely we eventually departed just after after a delay of over five and a half hours now i know stuff happens but let s not forget that we were departing from one of ba s home airports and why they couldn t have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody s guess various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from gatwick being dumbed down by ba in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of heathrow i have no idea whether this is true or not but i would ask one question if this flight had been a morning flight from heathrow to jfk would ba have found a solution quicker once in the air the flight was fine nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay

2167, flew british airways from new york jfk to london heathrow most comfortable seats i ve been in very ergonomic plane was clean clear screen and nice selection of music tv shows and recent movies easy to navigate i also enjoyed the multiple views of the flight from the overhead map to the mock pilot screen attendants were very polite and dinner was served quickly food was as good as i ve had on air france flights i will definitely try to book with them for future trips 
2168, after a hiatus of almost years the heathrow to inverness route was reinstated in may for the last few years travelling to inverness from geneva we have been using easyjet via gatwick so i thought it would be interesting to see how ba compares to its budget rival when travelling to the north of scotland overall i would say not particularly favourably bag drop i checked in online so just had to go through bag drop however with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers versus agents for business passengers ba bag drop in geneva was a slow and painful experience and slower than i have recently experienced with easyjet in geneva boarding in geneva was fairly smooth no better or worse than easyjet in flight staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast of a ham and cheese croissant could best be described as awful a croissant in name only given the price premium my overall opinion is that ba are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines 
2169, flew with british airways on a hour flight from dubai to london in economy with the tiniest tv screen i have seen in the last years it was so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on and the resolution was terrible and irritated the eyes the screen had little crosses in it this must have been an ancient plane the movie selection was old given that i watched the same movies months earlier nothing that is currently in the cinema we only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits we were also not allowed to have any sparkling wine which is ridiculous as they have it on tap in business class the staff seemed irritated most of the time especially the lady in business class who welcomed us very disappointing experience 
2170, going against the grain somewhat i have to say that i truly prefer flying with british airways over emirates on the london heathrow dubai route having tried both airlines several times i am definitely going to side with ba on this one firstly ba offer some really competitive prices on this route if you happen to have a few avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal secondly out of lhr ba really does have the best terminal okay so terminal for emirates isn t the worst terminal in the world but i much prefer terminal spacious light and with good dining options as for the aircraft well it s a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the a or the retro classic that is the b i ll happily fly in either although even after the refit the is still showing it s age as an economy passenger i have found the product on british airways to be perfectly reasonable the seat pitch is average seat comfort is average ife screen size again is average you get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options with emirates you have a huge ife thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch however i ve also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that i have no interest in watching i d rather just take my ipad preloaded with films i actually want to watch the lack of wifi isn t a huge concern for me hopefully the gogo ku product ba is installing from will be more robust now for the catering as an economy passenger i m not expecting much but on the last few flights with ba i have been pleasantly surprised the food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty where ba falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful it s also the little extras that i notice a pre dinner drinks service coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal as opposed to soft cheese i m not years old with ba you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing it s just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the emirates economy offering i ve found the crew to be hit and miss in fairness i ve found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them the recent newspaper deal with the murdoch empire is a nice touch along with the daily hate and i newspapers to choose from you also get the times the sun and financial times as complimentary options arrivals for ba at dxb is a bit of a nightmare terminal immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic however the new concourse d for departures is really nice not too blingy overall a pleasant flight i would happily fly with ba again

2173, this was a flight from gatwick to bermuda on a with british airways the aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive i am ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy aer lingus i m talking about you but there was ample leg room indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft i didn t notice a big difference in leg room i haven t flown ba for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy not this time though my meal was reasonably nice chicken korma and my fianc e had no complaints either with her pasta dish the crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange the ife had a good selection though one gripe is the positioning of the controls there is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest this controller controls the ife as well as your reading light and call button more than once i accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position a small gripe but it was quite annoying another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection i was on continental and virgin a couple of years ago and don t believe i had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme overall aside from the small ife issues a thoroughly pleasant flight

2179, london to paris cdg in business class british airways has always been one of my favourite airlines however there are just a few points that really bugs me the business class check in counter queue was longer in comparison to other counter e g economy at terminal at security the fast track queue were also longer 
2180, every airline which offers business class travel will assign seats when booking the flight the exception is british airways in january i booked a flight for two passengers on ba in business class from san francisco to london and back for travel in may june seats in business class are not assigned until hours before flight time however and here comes another ba first if you want to choose your seats before that time you can do so by paying an extra fee i ended up shelling out for the privilege of selecting two seats for the return flight this on top of the steep fare charged for travel in business class i don t begrudge the airlines for their extra profits when the price of fuel takes a massive drop but when an airline then also engages in tactics as described in order to further maximize profitability i rebel

2182, amsterdam to sao paulo via london heathrow with british airways comfort on the a was very good stylish leather seats with adjustable headrests i had mixed feelings about the boeing to sao paulo the headrests and recline were very good however ife was very outdated and limited and because of the seat recline hard to see the screen also personal space when the passanger in front was in full recline became almost claustophobic on all flights i found the crew professional friendly but somewhat reserved i found the quality and quantity of catering very good 
2183, london city to glasgow with british airways outrageous red tape flight delayed to glasgow so asked if i could go on the earlier flight no baggage etc sorry madam there are empty seats but the time of sales has passed so we cannot put you on the earlier flight that leaves in minutes other airlines let you fly standby except for british airways they delay a flight and won t switch you to an earlier flight that has space due to ridiculous red tape this isn t the first time that this has happened worst customer service ever just pure laziness anytime i have the option i will be flying a different airline 
2184, my partner and i were flying from london heathrow to bombay in march and were due to catch an onward flight to goa unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital the redirection meant that we arrived in bombay hours late and wouldn t make our connecting flight when we touched down in bombay the flight attendants said that ba ground staff would help us with missed flights connections etc and we should speak with them when we disembarked on this advice we sought out uniformed ba ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do they advised us to exit the hall and find an airport based travel agent and purchase new flights to goa when we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that ba would definitely cover it and went on to say that we should wait days before making a claim through the website armed with this advice from ba staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets big mistake since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement here is the reply we received from ba customer relations we ve received a reply from mumbai who ve investigated your case the agent you spoke to can t specifically remember speaking to you personally he did mention he d advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements he also mentioned ba wasn t responsible for any onward travel costs this is an outright lie i can only conclude that the ba staff member we spoke with in bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers either way british airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up

2186, we were treated incredibly well and staff made our trip as memorable as possible having found out we heading off on our honeymoon the champagne flowed and they looked after us so well in particular an irish fa was amazing to us and i d like to thank him and the staff on the flight we will recommend british airways to friends and family and this trip would make me choose ba for future flights 
2187, i was scheduled to be on ba from jfk to lhr on th of may when i conducted online check in i was informed that the flight will be one hour late i proceed to jfk and at check in they kindly moved me to an earlier flight ba check in was easy and smooth terminal at jfk is nothing exciting very limited shopping dining and not enough seating it feels like a lcc terminal i was greeted by friendly crew once onboard the hardware again is very dated tiny screen old seat and interior legroom was decent though and because the flight is empty i had plenty of space to stretch out the flight left jfk with a minor delay as it s a light flight most passengers were sleeping service was done in a very discreet way the food quality is nothing to write home about overall it s a typical ba flight very efficient and friendly crew with a very dated and unattractive product we arrived at heathrow early despite the late departure in jfk t was a pleasant airport to arrive spacious and airy and there was no queue in immigration it took me less than minutes to leave the airplane travel from t c to t a clear immigration and collect luggage 
2188, british airways from london heathrow to new york jfk on a boeing which hasn t been refitted checked in at heathrow t was smooth and quick t is pleasant enough used the ba galleries lounge in t a south it was busy with very limited food choice during breakfast although the wine selection was decent the lounge lacks atmosphere and is very basic in my opinion the flight left heathrow late as usual but the captain assured us that we would make up the time and should arrive early the hardware of this particular flight is sub standard very old interior worn carpet dated toilet and a small screen with poor resolution entertainment provided was very limited and not as what s being advertised on the website amenity pack provided is also very basic in a way i felt i was on premium economy of some asian airlines however the seat itself was ok as it has plenty of leg room and is comfortable although i am not a big fan of the ying yang design the service onboard was very friendly and informal a full service after take off and an afternoon tea before landing i felt that service has been consistent and is the biggest asset of the airline it s always let down by it s inferior hardware product i will always prefer to fly asian airlines

2190, flew british airways london heathrow to warsaw for a long weekend departure from lhr t was smooth although the terminal is crowded and dated flight left on time and arrived on time return days later with a delay of an hour on both lags of the journey the service was efficient and professional a small pack of food and a full bar service was provided the food was not of high quality planes were clean and have the refitted interior seat pitch was extremely tight similar to that of easyjet as i purchased a hand luggage only ticket ba charged to change my seats even during the online check in process i find this unacceptable for a full service airlines as i can even choose my seat with easyjet i used to prefer ba for its service and seat comfort but nowadays it seems that ba is no different than a budget airline it s a shame as the service is always good
2191, barbados to gatwick on ba flight left on time and arrived at gatwick slightly ahead of schedule as many have commented the british airways configuration in club world is odd and i can only assume they chose this to get extra seats in compared with a more traditional layout as the flight was overnight my wife and i decided to chose the two centre rear facing seats which offered least disturbance the downside of this is you can get missed and in my case the cabin crew passed me at the meal service and i had to gesture to get them back food and drink service was however otherwise fine breakfast included a bacon roll which was nice flatbed reasonable comfortable and we got a few hours sleep 
2192, british airways from gatwick to barbados on boeing flight departed on time and arrived at bridgestone on schedule i had seat k and my wife j on our outbound flight seat configuration may be a bit odd but suited us for a day time flight and made conversation easy although the window seat could be a bit claustrophobic with the partition up food and drinks were very good we both had chosen the fillet steak for the main course and although cooked a bit longer than we would prefer was still moist and tasty wine and champagne selection very good cabin crew were faultless for example my wife asked for a jasmine tea and although this is not included in their selection the stewardess offered one of her one teabags only real disappointment was the ife the b aircraft are showing their age and the technology is dated however the biggest problem is the video and audio selections which ae very inferior than many airlines

2197, family of adults flying british airways from bangkok to london and i wished i had done my homework first regarding aircraft type the only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that s where it stops the seat was old the footrest would not operate correctly as a oneworld gold frequent flyer was able to get st row in premium economy x by window the pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away hrs with no entertainment is a very long time the food was probably the worst i ve ever experienced the main meal comes from the business class menu not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete could not be eaten hence left behind noticed other passengers did the same mid flight snack ok light meal prior to landing was inedible a lasagna that just the look of it put me off hence left behind hrs min flight the catering is very average we have now rebooked at a premium cost to fly back via kuala lumpur on the boeing with the new premium product interesting to see how that compares would i recommend british airways crew wise yes actual product catering etc no advice check which aircraft you are flying on

2199, london heathrow to newark two evenings prior to my flight i used british airways android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me at the time advance reservation of regular seats was and for front section extended legroom seats i had no interest in reserving a regular seat i could wait until hours before check in for that but i was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats so i paid the for the two front section seats when my wife and i boarded the craft lo and behold the seats were not front section seats at all i was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my android phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely apologizing to us offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post flight however subsequent to the flight british airways has been positively nasty in their response claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued true enough and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front section when they were not the fact that i received zero goods or services for my beyond what i was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them they have managed to bilk me out of and having gotten their hands on my money they intend to keep it we ll see what my credit card company has to say about this but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company suffice it to say that my wife and i will not be flying ba again

2203, british airways have seriously gone downhill there is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines i would actually prefer easyjet and ryanair as at least they are transparent this journey from lyon to london heathrow was chaotic and stressful thanks to ba charging to check in luggage one way every passenger takes cabin baggage this means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made the boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out i have honestly never seen anything like it once on board they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn t fit passengers were arguing with one another separate fights were witnessed and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move the meal service is a joke a pathetic barely edible sandwich as always with ba flights to and from lhr this flight was late we ended up flying round and round over london for mins the worst thing is ba s new policy of charging to select a seat even at online check in opening hours before this means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay just to change it to any normal seat and even more if extra legroom ba s new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way and charge more than other airlines in the process a shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost i will definitely be avoiding them wherever possible

2206, london heathrow to seoul incheon with british airways good service from fas and a high quality screen for ife but what a shame that otherwise british airways business class seats badly need up dating once a trail blazer british airways is now an also ran why didn t they ensure that the company took advantage of its new aircraft to bring its facilities up to date to make up at least some of the ground on the gulf and leading asian carriers

2208, berlin to philadelphia via london heathrow i ve traveled with british airways many times and always thought it was a decent airline and preferred it for my trips back to philadelphia over some of the other airlines however this last trip has changed my mind and i will no longer fly with ba we were given misprinted tickets for our connecting flight in lhr which led to us missing our flight despite showing our tickets to several ba employees we rushed to the gate printed on our tickets where the woman at the counter informed us our flight was departing from a the terminal where we had just come from we had to run with all our carry on luggage and winter clothing the distance the train normally takes you upon reaching a we saw it s actually sub divided in sections a a b c etc this caused even more confusion at first it took us the wrong way of course when we finally found the correct gate the flight was already gone the ba employee at the gate apologized and told us to require to be rebooked because the problem was the fault of his colleague at the customer service counter they also admitted the mistake and pointed it out to a colleague who also agreed they had never seen this kind of error before another woman in line behind us had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reason the customer service woman did her best for us and gave us new tickets but for a much later flight and advised us write you in order to follow it up when we did try to follow it up i was sent a response that was clearly cut and pasted with errors and typos and did not address the issue of my complaint i tried to call a few times to speak to an agent in person but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several euros customer service was terrible and i can t imagine how it would have been if there was a more serious issue aside from this the flights were cramped and the entertainment system was outdated small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against the screen to get it to work not to mention the beginning of our flight way back until after the food was served the system was out of order the last complaint is about the airline food as a vegetarian normally i like bas food but this time it was a joke my special meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular meal the pasta was one of the worst i ve had on flight and when breakfast came around i got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner while everyone else received a full box of food it was so bad it was comical

2222, chicago to amsterdam via london club world club europe after a very nice first flight from tampa to chicago with my wife and our months old baby transit in chicago was really smooth our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal we did not have to pass security a second time so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge as a gold member i checked the first lounge but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too we found a quiet dinner part of the business lounge were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax food was decent boarding the upper deck of this boeing was a pleasure with a csd welcoming us by name flight was excellent food amazing enough cold drinks were offered cabin crew looking after us and our baby our baby was playing all the time singing and talking his own words after this perfect flight transit in lhr terminal was again relaxing stroller was again waiting for us at the gate very nice after security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded but we found a quiet place to sit time for a shower breakfast and relax last flight to amsterdam was in a full cabin nice and frriendly cabin crew the only small remark we can find is that this last flight there was no stroller waiting for us but it arrived with our luggage 
2223, rome to london heathrow with british airways and the flight itself was efficient and on time comfortable seat nice entertainment but the ground service was terrible we were the first flight of the day and the clerks at the counter arrived to find of us standing in queue they got their stuff ready to work sat in their chairs then just sat their and ignored us for minutes or so the cabin crew didn t win any awards for friendliness either they did their job but i won t say much more the food served was adequate at best this was my second time flying british airways and i have not been impressed either time there are better choices 
2224, i usually do not have a problem with british airways but my flight from london heathrow to toronto on rd april was the worst flight i have been on they said a minute delay which turned out to be a hour delay and they also kept changing the gate number they only gave us a gbp which you had to spend in the same shop and on top of this our bags were lost along with of the planes this was very inconvenient as we have no clothes and arrived at am 
2225, travelled british airways from manchester to dubai return via heathrow with family the outbound flight was a night service and dinner was served at am the children didn t eat as they were fast asleep but the food was nothing special supermarket ready meal standard leg room was horrific and it truly felt like cattle class on the return flight the seats were worn and old screens were old and scratched the children weren t given their choice of meals as they had run out my three year old was given snack a box containing nuts my husband sitting next to her was asleep i was in the row behind and quickly took it away as she s allergic i could go on but you get the picture the man sat next to me didn t get any food on a hr plus flight he was vegetarian and they had run out of pasta from my experience i won t fly or recommend british airways anymore the days of glory are long gone 
2226, london to philadelphia having booked business class and paid the non refundable fee british airways would not let me check in on line when i reached terminal they bumped me due to overbooking they offered me a downgrade that i could not accept for health reasons if they had told me they were overbooked when i tried to check in online i could have rerouted via new york and still arrived in time for an important meeting as it was i arrived hours late and missed my meeting british airways only cares about maximising its profits it cares nothing for its passengers i have been a loyal customer of ba for over years for many years i was a gold card holder and this is how they treat me they sold me a product and then sold the same product to someone else after i had paid the full and non refundable fare they used to be good their strapline the world s favourite airline was not far from the truth no longer they are rapidly becoming the world s least favourite airline

2230, flew london heathrow to hong kong the british airways first class experience was fantastic the cabin crew could not do enough to make my flight one i will not forget the ba experience started at check in and continued right until the moment i stepped off the plane in hong kong the staff all certainly demonstrated their commitment to the ba slogan to fly to serve i chose the first course tasting menu exclusive to the a each course came with a paired wine each course was tasty and well presented the crew took the time to describe each course as it was being served and continually topped up the wine all food and beverages served were of a very high standard and quality the seat was roomy and very comfortable the fully flat bed was comfortable mattress topper cotton sheets duvet and pillows i am over feet tall and had lots of space in my suite for sleeping i slept for over hours and woke up refreshed

2232, london heathrow nairobi kenya boeing not new but clean departed on time food was very average and was served at am as a lunch bland and uninteresting cabin crew very quick and efficient but then ran away for most of the flight so that they could get the service over as quickly as possible an hour before landing they reappeared again with cardboard boxes with a chicken sandwich a drink and that was it you sometimes wonder whether british airways check the quality of the offers made by other airlines or whether it is just customer loyalty that keeps them flying nairobi arrival was a nightmare as my electronic visa had a page not dowloaded and this resulted in an extra hour and a half with immigration before it was sorted out 
2233, left nairobi more or less on time had to wait for a thunderstorm to pass before take off premium economy seat is better than economy in that there is more leg room flight was packed and the was subdivided into first club business premium economy and economy not sure whether all these subdivisions are really necessary it would have been better to provide customers with a more modern newer aircraft instead of an older with all these seating alternatives that look rather dated food was average choice between grilled steak and chicken and a vegetable salad starter and dried out cake as a dessert cabin crew efficient but hardly any warmer than the food they seemed to want to get the meal out of the way as quickly as possible it was a night flight and they disappeared until hour before landing when the dreaded cardboard box appeared pretending to be breakfast a pot of yoghurt and a dreadful dry cereal bar arrived on time and immediately went for a coffee and a snack at the airport which of course should have been served as a breakfast on the flight british airways needs to wake up and check what other airlines offer on the same flight 
2234, vancouver to barcelona via heathrow with british airways i would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews i ve taken time to write in my life were positive ones choosing to ignore negativity this however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that i m taking time to write this before we ve even completed our round trip with british airways to be more direct i m writing this on our final connector flight to barcelona on february th i purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from vancouver canada to barcelona spain this was a surprise for fiance for her th birthday as well as our year engagement anniversary naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a barcelona fc match even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our month old daughter april th day before our trip i receive a email labeled updated travel itinerary when i opened the email our flights no longer included our flight from vancouver to barcelona actually they only had a return flight from barcelona on april th as i had got home late on april th from cuba i couldn t contact anyone until early morning of april th my fiance s birthday convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been cancelled we tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the th and i follow on the th which as an engaged couple makes no sense we decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late this began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form separate times only for the screen to read submitting for roughly minutes each time never one actually submitting we decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at yvr the agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it she put a note on our file that an agent from jacksonville ba had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason we asked for an upgrade on our seats that wasn t available to us we asked for access to the ba lounge while we waited we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight after a very uncomfortable flight to heathrow we spoke to an agent there who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses which unfortunately still wouldn t get us the day we missed back she went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows that was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains while we snacked on a of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum empty seats we are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home

2237, i am writing to complain about my deeply distressing british airways flight from london heathrow cape town with a change at johannesburg the flight was badly managed throughout when i arrived at heathrow i was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system she eventually found it she then said oh im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight i was obviously distressed by this as imagined i would have to return back to dorset however after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat i arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to johannesburg however we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport in this time there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane once on the plane again we waited and waited and waited and eventually we were told that sorry for the inconvenience but ba did not have enough time to the the engineering works or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day so we were extremely late in setting off from heathrow i think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait i was concerned about catching my next flight from johannesburg to cape town the flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of ba ground staff to help us all when we arrive at johannesburg however this could not have been further from the truth once landed there were no british airways staff present except for one lady in a high vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to run to the next gate for the flight she then pointed at a man he was wearing no uniform saying he will take me and another passenger to gate we literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip i gave him but was extremely suprised that i would have to tip someone who supposedly ba advised me to go withonce getting to the gate and just in time the lady at comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets and rudely shouted at me as to why did you leave your luggage by this point i had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed she then told us to just go back with no further help luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the ba check in desk to ask for new tickets to cape town once at the ba deskthey were not helpful in the slightest they simply told me to go and get my luggage from a menzies which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there i ran too and fro the menzies lost luggage to the comair and ba office back and forth for around hours no staff were helpful even though i was crying and feeling completely bewildered

2239, cancelled a british airways flight to gibraltar within cooling off period they advised refund takes hrs many calls later still no refund promised on april would get refund within hours as of april ba can t say when will be refunded payment due april for replacement ba flight booked after first flight was cancelled and need refund to pay balance ba don t care holding and won t say when it will be refunded loyal customer for years appalling customer service and ba say if payment due on th april not made for replacement booking it will be cancelled and i will lose deposit despite the fact they are keeping of my money and have lied repeatedly as to when it will be refunded ba flights are now a nightmare last flights travelled on were delayed due to hand baggage only passengers marauding up and down the aisle trying to stuff oversize hand luggage into overhead lockers with no care or consideration for other passengers possessions captain had to announce unless people sat down and allowed hand baggage to be placed in hold plane would be further delayed british airways needs to decide whether it wants to be a no frills airline or not it is now worse than ryanair or easyjet not a pleasant experience to fly ba anymore despite having problems of one type or another on nearly every booking made with ba in the last few years continued to be loyal to them but they do not appreciate customer loyalty despite their recorded customer services message claiming they want to maintain high standards after travel and wish to ensure a passenger flies with ba again they fail on all counts

2242, flew london to beijing with british airways the flight leaves from heathrow terminal normally beijing flight leaves from b gates so i made myself comfortable at the b gate lounge which is times better than the two a gate congested lounges before the flight it was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable though quite full the ba club seats are configured across and the seat is not as wide as competitor s but just enough cx may have better seat but ba sometime offers good value the service is good it has a chinese crew and unlike with cathay the crew are always the same on this route because they are based in china specifically for the london route so a frequent flyer may be recognized and get treated better it was an on time flight 
2243, this was my second time flying with british airways and this particular route from vancouver to paris cdg via london heathrow round trip was overall on time without delay online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats i wanted picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems the food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently washrooms were clean overall a satisfactory experience however one thing almost all travellers on the yvr lhr route will notice is the age of this aircraft i think it should be replaced soon since this is a very popular route i flew in late march and return beginning of april being low season but the cabin was still full i think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the a particularly the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket the in flight entertainment system is also very out dated pictures were not clear and colours were rather misleading 
2244, london heathrow to paris cdg with british airways nothing special for a short flight but was happy that it was on time it is interesting that for short haul flight ba uses seating that the business seats are the same as economy except that the central seat is kept empty and on this flight it was not full so i have similar space with my next seat unoccupied snack was offered free though not hot together with a drink 
2245, hong kong to london with british airways i normally prefer aisle seats for long haul but this flight i chose a window seat because it was an a flight on the upper deck the upper deck situation means that i can take advantage of a window side drawer where apart from easy storage i can also put something on top and premium economy offers just enough space to move out if needed ba s premium economy service is good the food is not the same for economy as in the case of some airlines and the seat acceptably comfortable ba is generous on alcoholic drinks though i do not take advantage of it but the food is not very good all in all the flight was satisfactory 
2246, to our amazement we went to board our flight back to london after our holiday in the west coast of the usa and found we were upgraded from economy to club world it was especially nice for my fianc e who has only flown economy previously the service and food were very good and the flat bed seat made the flight much more pleasant the a is a lovely aircraft because it is so quiet and looks very smart inside 
2247, i decided to treat myself to british airways premium economy from beijing to london which was not much more expensive than economy i had a bulkhead seat which meant i had plenty of legroom and could stretch out on the flight the cabin looked a bit tired but the staff were friendly and professional and i was comfortable the food was quite good but a glass of champagne when we boarded would have been nice the ife was okay but the screen was small and it malfunctioned during part of the flight 
2248, on our recent holiday to the usa i was very excited to be flying on the new a for the first time after some food in the excellent terminal we went to board and found we were upgraded to premium economy the aircraft was smart and fresh inside and we were welcomed with champagne the a is by far the quietest aircraft i have ever flown and the ife was good with lots of choice the food was decent and we had friendly and professional service on the plane and at heathrow

2250, riyadh to dusseldorf via heathrow with british airways check in at riyadh was terrible broken baggage belts and staff explaining to passangers that there is an issue instead of fixing it flight to lhr was smooth and with good service lhr however was a disaster priority security took forever and the gate agent was even worse i have a trolley and handluggage as specified first she started complaining about the trolley surprise it was within size then she looked at my laptop case which was cm too large and made me check in the trolley worst of all was her attitude in this i feel that her customer bashing behavior definitely did not comply with the ba image and expectations from businesses class passengers i will search other options before choosing ba again 
2251, british airways used to be better than this i spent all afternoon in the business lounge waiting for my gatwick flight at pm my boarding card said the gate closed at and when i hadn t heard any announcement by i asked the ba man at reception if there was a delay i was very dismayed when he casually said yes about hour mins i was very unhappy they had not told us earlier or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner there was a time when ba would have tried to reroute its premium passengers but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this he told me that if i wanted to switch to an earlier lhr or lcy flight i would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights onboard i had my first experience of ba s new club europe wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray to give the perception of more space without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom from my experiences of ba business class in both long and short haul over the past year it is very sad to see that ba is focussing on making changes which make it more money rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience my meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was and it wasn t at all tasty but a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into so that i could hold on to it on approach to lgw that was a very nice touch i hadn t been offered before on any airline i ve flown with 
2252, it is very irritating that british airways pre allocated me a middle seat which i was not allowed to change when checking in online unless i paid pounds at the airport self service check in would not let me change seat either so i had to find a customer service desk to get my preferred window seat a waste of my time and theirs the short flight from london gatwick to amsterdam was ok flight crew spoke to the cabin a few times which i appreciate but cabin crew clearly wished they were somewhere else my catering choice was water and crisps hardly full service but at least it was free

2255, london city to isle of man with british airways following a not unexpected cancellation of our flight from gatwick with easyjet they seem to be become more and more unreliable we purchased tickets with ba from london city despite earlier weather problems and with storm katie approaching they made the effort to operate a flight back to the isle of man and got us all home well done ba 
2256, this flight from copenhagen to london heathrow was british airways but operated by jet time who are operating some ba services on the lhr cph route this summer the aircraft was definitely not up to ba standards old very worn inside cabin service i cannot comment on as fortunately i had seats together so slept most of the flight i really hope this is a temporary move on ba s part as this really is not the standard i have come to expect from them on this route

2260, london gatwick to rome fiumicino if anyone has flown british airways club europe you ll realise it s the same seat as their economy class eurotraveller with a seat made into a divider in the middle as i was flying from gatwick the ba lounge was under refurbishment and was directed into no lounge which was quite packed already when i got to rome my baggage was lost to make matters worse the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of british airways was very poorly marked there was no sign or logo of british airways it was manned by two person which hadn t had a clue what was going on and would only assist in filling up the forms to make matters worse they were talking to each other leaving my partner and i just awkwardly staring at them to complete their conversation bottom line is whatever carries the british airway brand name is good whatever rd party organisation which ba employs are questionable 
2261, washington to dubai return via heathrow on british airways outbound segment on an a and three others on refurbished b aircraft as a regular year customer and a gold level executive club member one has to expect much variation in the ba onboard product staff are generally polite and hardworking some are not very well trained so seem to lack the extra attention to detail that should come with club world the fish main course served between iad and lhr was unbelievably bad but other meals were fairly good high tea without scones clotted cream and strawberry jam is an absurd cost cutting measure on a british airline as i discovered on the lhr iad sector it is sad to see this airline not working harder in response to the competition

2265, return from seville to gatwick on british airways a in economy flight left a few minutes ahead of schedule and landed early as well seating was face lifted economy class and i think less comfortable than the older style we flew out on in an a sandwich and a drink okay i do think british airways could come around with a nd drink or water service on a hour flight overall okay 
2266, flew british airways from oslo to london heathrow on march crew were happy and helpful cabin clean and looked new it wasn t a new plane but the seats were new served a turkey and cheese croissant will fly again with ba was on time and landed early 
2267, gatwick to seville with british airways flight was delayed due to french air traffic controllers being on strike ba did their best to help we boarded on time and were ready to leave if a slot became available however we still got away nearly hours late they served drinks and also invited passengers to view the flightdeck during the delay once we took off flight was okay typical service with sandwich and drink wine was passable better than most shorthaul economy service seat was comfortable given the limited legroom 
2268, barcelona to seoul incheon via london heathrow and overall i was very impressed with my two flights on ba i d checked in online and bag drop at bcn took less than one minute a small snack was served on the flight to london which was uneventful the flight from london to seoul was on the new and was almost perfect a very friendly professional crew ife was of a very high quality and amazing sound i was impressed by the size of both meals lunch and hot breakfast the only real let down was the seat it was tiny so narrow and i felt quite squashed in by it this made the flight uncomfortable and difficult to sleep this really let down what was a very good flight 
2269, istanbul to london heathrow with british airways the main reason i pay to travel business class is to get extra leg room ba s club europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in economy which may be okay for a quick hop to paris but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight it was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row the only row with reasonable leg room service was fine and the food quite good but no entertainment at all from now on i ll book economy and pay for exit seats it s a no brainer either that or fly turkish airlines an airline which is going from strength to strength 
2270, london heathrow to houston on british airways and very friendly and efficient service we chose asian vegetarian as meals which turned out to be tasty hadn t flown ba long haul for over years and improvement was noticeable free beverages were offered and there was a wide choice too baggage allowance was very adequate the transfer at terminal at lhr worked very well 
2271, we have flown with british airways over times usually in business class on our current ski trip we paid a substantial premium to fly one way in first and home from london to denver in business class yesterday our flight was cancelled due to snow this of course is not their fault after spending nearly an hour on hold to their gold card premium service line we were told that all the flights are full so they cannot help we are not authorised to help with this on the telephone you have to drive to the airport and ask beg the airport staff to consider using a different carrier to help get you home for a long planned family easter holiday the true test of a company is not when things are going well it is what they do when there is a problem ba com have been truly appalling the email cancelling our flight did not even include a phone number to call for rebooking 
2272, british airways from seattle to johannesburg via london heathrow first leg sea to lhr was on a the plane was satisfactory to me i don t understand the comments from people who think the is tired or worn out not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn t recline their seat i sat in one of the twosomes seat a in the tail the food on this leg was bland the continental breakfast was a disappointment i would buy seat a again if i was traveling on a british airways but be advised there is no wall next to a that you can lean on to sleep second leg was on an a i sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat a this time the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire hours of the flight the a is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way the upper cabin on an a is amazingly quiet the food on this leg was far better with an english breakfast served prior to landing in jo burg i would not play for seat a again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of a that limit foot room but i would play for seat b which is an aisle seat ife on both legs was pretty sad but i m not one for popular culture cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job ba ground personnel at heathrow were very nice and helpful i ve traveled between south africa and north america about a dozen times over the past two years flights that require you to change planes in the middle east or europe fly over africa and so tend to be very bumpy even at night when most convective activity dies down nonstop flights that are routed over the atlantic ocean tend to be much smoother

2274, gatwick to amsterdam in business class was truly the most uncomfortable flight of my life i thought that with british airways i might expect something a little better what a stupid mistake the business class seats are standard economy class with middle seat empty food for breakfast was okay although not enough if you were hungry but luckily they provide champagne during the flight
